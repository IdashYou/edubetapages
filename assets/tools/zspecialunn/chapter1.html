        <p><strong>ABOUT THE APP</strong></p>

        <p><strong>ABOUT THE APP</strong></p>
<p>The content of this App was prepared by a group of UNN graduates who have the goal of making UNN PUTME easier for students. We know that you have past questions and good textbooks but there is more to UNN PUTME than you can see. We interviewed many students that scored above 320 in both Science and Art, and from their common secrets we created this app to contain many features that are not in textbooks or past questions. The app also contains the highest number of past questions so far, and many more contents that you can&rsquo;t find anywhere. Please make sure you finish everything in the App at least 2 times before the exam. You must make it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>STRUCTURE OF UNN PUTME SCREENING EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>The Exam is not Paper and Pen but CBT based just like your JAMB Exam. You don't have to come with any paper or calculator. You will only be allowed to come in with Your reprinted print-out containing the date and venue for your screening, and a pen if you need it.</p>
<p>Sometimes they provide a plane paper for those that might like to solve questions on a rough paper.</p>
<p>You will be writing 4 courses which is already selected for you. For each course you have 17 questions, and you are expected to answer any 15 from the 17.</p>
<p>NB: You cannot cancel any question you have answered, you can only change the option you selected in that particular number.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p><em>Let's assume you answered from number 1 to 15, and on seeing number 16, you notice it is easier than the one you answered in number 1. At this point you can't unmark number 1 to answer number 16.</em></p>
<p>So, always avoid questions you are not sure of, since you are not expected to answer all. But always make sure you answered up to 15 Questions for each Course, unless they change the instruction.</p>
<p>Time limit: you have 1 hour to finish the four courses. That is 60minutes for 60 questions. With our App you can really master practically how to use your time, by enabling timer when practicing past questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW EASY IS UNN PUTME?</strong></p>
<p>UNN PUTME is easier for those that knows the secrets behind the success.</p>
<p>Mark the word "EASIER"</p>
<p>Earlier on we assumed its a game of luck, till a team of UNN Graduates conducted a research on some students who did extremely well in both Art and Science courses, scoring above 320, and the research was successful as we found common secrets among them, that enabled them to do well. We thank God, that they were able to open up and here we have a solution for those who want to make it into the Den (UNN), by merit.</p>
<p>The reason why the exam is designed to be hard, is due to the number of students that are in need of admission. This is why it is getting more challenging every year. People that failed last year will join this year.</p>
<p>Many people come for the exam with their secondary school mindset of passing the screening. This is where failure starts, because it is a competitive exam which UNN use as a means to solve the problem of selecting few students from the thousands upon thousands of candidates writing the PUTME.</p>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s take for instance Medicine and Surgery which not more than 120 students will make it in the first list, then normally the remaining 180 Students that will be admitted are those who have the advantage of a strong and reliable connection with the school Administration. So, the percentage for a normal student is 0.012%.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am sorry if this is annoying but you can do it.</p>
<p>The Goal is not to make you scared, but to lead you to see what you will be facing soon. My first PUTME is ever memorable, I was feeling so unprepared few hours before the exam because I realized that I wasn't really prepared as I ought to.</p>
<p>UNN PUTME Normally is more difficult than JAMB, but some students get more than what they scored in JAMB, why?</p>
<p>We have also seen many average students that performed extremely well, while some so-called best students in some secondary schools perform poor, why?</p>
<p>I wish that everyone that comes across this write up will learn from the result of our research.</p>
<p>Average students can score a very high grade in PUTME, if they have rightly used the keys.</p>
<p>Most good students don't do well in PUTME because they use the normal process of reading that they used in their Secondary school to write PUTME.</p>
<p>PUTME is different and must be prepared in a unique way.</p>
<p>If SS3 students that are yet to write WAEC who paid the price to work with the keys of success, are able to make it, then you can make it. You just need the right keys of success.</p>
<p>Most of us just assume that the secret is to read UNN past questions and JAMB Past Questions. Wow! this is good but we need an excellent plan. The secrets are given in the next page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4 NEW SUCCESS KEYS</strong></p>
<p>It pricks our heart that the current resources (Books and Past Questions) available are not sufficient to prepare students for UNN PUTME exams. This motivated us to create this App.</p>
<p>This App is a product of Some Smart UNN Graduates, we actually conducted many researches before we discovered some untold secrets about UNN PUTME Screening.</p>
<p>This made us to come up with this app to enable the students to prepare better and smarter. We know you have Good textbooks and Past questions when we prepared the App. It is for those who want to fly higher.</p>
<p>Here are some secrets of success in the App, which will help you to perform excellently in the Exam hall.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extra Notes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We noticed that, there are questions that memorizing JAMB and PUTME Questions can't save you from. Don't get me wrong, normal Past questions are very important but not perfect. We have a better plan. We prepared UNN PUTME EXAM FOCUSED SUMMARY NOTES for the courses you will be writing. It is not just like normal notes in your textbooks. It is designed to cover all the possible questions that will come in each topic, and each topic is followed with PUTME and JAMB expected questions on that topic for better understanding. This is because reading a topic without being able to answer a question in that topic is useless. Don&rsquo;t do blind reading during preparation, remember that your goal is to be able to answer questions, not just to understand the topic.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Smart Covering of Past Questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We also noticed that many students try to read every JAMB past question but this is really not smart because there is how the brain works. Things register in your brain faster when they are closely associated. That is why we grouped some expected JAMB and PUTME questions according to topic in our summary notes, with supporting explanations.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Areas of Concentration</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All topics are not read in the same proportion. Intact you will never see some topics that are in your textbook. We have identified areas of concentration in each topic in within the notes. So, pay attention to those points. You are free to finish what ever book you wish to finish but never play with the areas of concentration in the App&rsquo;s note. Make sure you master all of them, and revise them few days before the exam.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Practical Time Management</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Time is a big issue. Most students end up not finishing their questions although they know the answers. This is because they just practiced with Past Questions. Time management may not look like a problem to you now, till you enter the hall. You might be distracted, maybe due to system issues. So, you need to really know how to finish as fast as possible. With our CBT past question in the App you can test yourself by enabling Timer while taking the test. Set the time to be less than the PUTME time to train your mind to be fast. It is like UNN CBT exam, with stop time and calculator. And you don't need Internet connection to use the App, so you can even put your phone in Airplane mode.</p>
<p>There are many advantages of using the app, the users can testify, follow us on Facebook to see more ways to gain maximally in the App. You don&rsquo;t have to fail; we have the Key.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to involve God. He will bless your efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to come early on the exam day. Come a day before your exam and see your venue, so that the next day you just match straight into the hall and write well. On that day there will be go slow on the road, so stay close to school to avoid stories. You can contact any campus fellowship Exco listed in the App for help in terms of accommodation</li>
<li>Stay connected with us, so that you will get all the information you need, both general information and special information for our App users. We love you and we want you to succeed.</li>
<li>Stay motivated, keep working hard, you are about to become a lion.</li>
<li>You must win.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRAYER FOR SUCCESS IN PUTME</strong></p>
<p>Prayer is an essential ingredient for Success, God has a role to play in your success. Pray strategically and continuously. Most students we interviewed also mentioned prayer as one of their keys of success.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray for Direction on what to study. Ask God to direct you to areas of concentration, so that you will know all the questions that will come out.</li>
<li>Pray for retentive memory, that you will not forget what you read on the examination day.</li>
<li>Pray that God will remove every distraction from your sight to allow you to focus in your studies during preparation, and also pray that you won&rsquo;t experience any problem during the PUTME Exercise.</li>
<li>Pray that you and your family will be in good health.</li>
<li>Pray that everything about UNN PUTME will work together for your good, both the decisions and every plan of the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now rejoice and thank God for he is faithfulness, if God be for you who can be against you. Please try and give your life to Christ and make a confession of faith in Christ in a Bible believing Church (John 3:16). God is your maker and he knows the best way for you to fulfil your destiny. Remain blessed.</p>
