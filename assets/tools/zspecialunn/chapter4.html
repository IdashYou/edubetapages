</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>It's a good idea to start developing your CV while you're still at university. You can improve your skills by undertaking voluntary work, getting involved in medical school societies or becoming an academic course or clinical representative.</p>
<p>Skills and experience can also be gained from taking an elective, which is a period of clinical experience taken during your degree. A lot of students who take an elective decide to go abroad, with many going to developing countries.</p>
<p>Some medical students spend an additional year at medical school (lengthening a five year course to six years) studying for an&nbsp;intercalated degree. This involves taking a year out from the medical curriculum to study and carry out a research project in a different, usually science-related, subject area.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Most medical graduates go on to become doctors. Opportunities are available in both the National Health Service (NHS) and private hospitals, as well as in NHS practice trusts as a GP.</p>
<p>There are also opportunities for those wishing to practise medicine in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Armed Forces</li>
<li>overseas aid agencies</li>
<li>prisons</li>
<li>research institutes</li>
<li>clinical trial organisations</li>
<li>private healthcare establishments</li>
<li>residential nursing homes</li>
<li>air ambulance services</li>
<li>university teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>As well as the vocational skills you acquire when undertaking a degree in medicine, you also develop a range of other transferable skills through your course, such as critical appraisal, observation, listening, logical reasoning and decision making. These skills are crucial when working as a doctor, but are just as useful in work outside medicine.</p>
<p>Other transferable skills include written and oral communication, from completing assignments, taking histories and writing medical reports. You will also be able to work in a team, understanding your role and responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Most medicine graduates undertake the two-year&nbsp;UK Foundation Programme&nbsp;after graduation in order to practise medicine in the UK. In order to register with the&nbsp;General Medical Council (GMC), you must successfully complete the first year of the Foundation Programme and gain a Certificate of Experience.</p>
<p>Most doctors start further training immediately after the Foundation Programme, choosing to specialise in either general practice or a specialty. The number of years you'll spend in training varies - approximately three years for GP training and around five to seven years for specialties.</p>
<p>Many of the specialty programmes are initially broad, but as training progresses doctors can specialise in a particular area, such as cardiology. For more information on the range of specialties available, see&nbsp;NHS Health Careers.</p>
<p>Successful completion of this training leads to the award of a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT). Doctors are then eligible for entry to the specialist/GP register and can apply for a senior medical appointment.</p>
<p>A few graduates each year consider careers outside medicine. Those that do may undertake further vocational training in an area they wish to enter as a career, such as teaching or law. Others may undertake further study in areas such as finance, management or business to enhance their knowledge of a specific career area.</p>

</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>It's important to get relevant work experience to show potential employers that you're enthusiastic and that you can apply the skills you've learned during your course to the workplace.</p>
<p>Most retail chains offer summer placement programmes in community pharmacy lasting between six and eight weeks. Some employers will recruit their pre-registration trainees from these programmes.</p>
<p>You could find experience in a hospital pharmacy, although this may be unpaid work shadowing and last from a few days to a few weeks.</p>
<p>There may also be some opportunities to do a placement with a pharmaceutical company, depending on your areas of interest.</p>
<p>Experience in a retail environment or voluntary work in a healthcare setting will enable you to develop valuable skills, including customer or patient care, and will increase your knowledge of over-the-counter medications.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>The majority of community pharmacists in the UK work in large retail chains or independent pharmacies of various sizes. Others are employed by small or medium-sized chain stores, GP surgeries or health centres.</p>
<p>The majority of hospital pharmacists work for hospitals within the NHS. It's also possible to work for private hospitals.</p>
<p>Qualified pharmacists can work as locum (temporary replacement) pharmacists, either on a self-employed basis or through an agency.</p>
<p>Pharmacy graduates are also employed in industry by private sector organisations, such as pharmaceutical companies and food and drink companies, to work in areas such as research and development, quality assurance, marketing, sales and management.</p>
<p>Other types of employers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the armed services - you can work as a military pharmacist for the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force</li>
<li>universities and research institutions - for a career as an academic pharmacist</li>
<li>veterinary pharmacy practices - you can work as a veterinary pharmacist for specialist practices, university veterinary schools, the pharmaceutical industry, and government departments and agencies such as the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>Studying pharmacy enables you to develop skills specific to the role of a pharmacist, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of facts and theories relating to the design and manufacture of medicines</li>
<li>the ability to communicate effectively with patients and other health professionals</li>
<li>production of pharmacy-specific scientific documentation</li>
<li>operation of pharmaceutical instrumentation</li>
<li>knowledge of the law and ethical concerns relating to the supply of medicines</li>
<li>analysis of medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You also develop a broad range of skills that are attractive to employers in other sectors as well. These include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>interpersonal skills</li>
<li>the ability to work well as part of a team</li>
<li>numeracy and computation</li>
<li>problem-solving skills and the ability to think clearly and methodically</li>
<li>time management and organisational skills</li>
<li>commercial awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Only small numbers of pharmacy graduates go on to further study directly after graduation. This is because a pre-entry postgraduate qualification is not needed to practise as a pharmacist and is rarely advantageous when applying for jobs within the profession.</p>
<p>Pharmacy graduates who want a career in scientific research and development may study for an MSc or PhD in fields such as pharmacy, prescribing and drug discovery and development, or in biomedical or chemical sciences.</p>
<p>Graduates who decide that they want to pursue careers outside pharmacy may undertake a relevant vocational or postgraduate course to broaden their skills and increase their knowledge of other areas.</p>

<li>Veterinary nurse</li>
<li>Zookeeper</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>As part of your degree you'll need to complete a minimum of 38 weeks extra-mural studies (EMS), gaining real-life, hands-on work experience to enhance your university-based studies. This experience can include time in clinical practices, abattoirs, laboratories, food production facilities and with government veterinary services. You can also complete an overseas placement.</p>
<p>You're expected to take responsibility for your own learning and get involved as much as you can. Practical experience will include work with various species, including companion animals such as cats and dogs, horses, farm animals and exotic species.</p>
<p>Some courses offer the opportunity to spend an additional year as part of an intercalated degree, providing you with chance to specialise in an area of particular interest, such as pathology, conservation or zoology, to undertake research and to broaden your career opportunities. Taking this path means you'll graduate with both a veterinary medicine and a science degree.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>The majority of vets are employed by private practices, varying from small to large, including animal hospitals. Mixed practices provide a breadth of experience - alternatively, you can specialise to care for particular animal groups such as exotic, small, farm, zoo/wildlife animals or horses.</p>
<p>There are opportunities in the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which employs vets working in operational, research and policy sectors. Jobs are mostly found with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Veterinary Medicine Directorate (VMD) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) (animal welfare).</p>
<p>Other opportunities exist within zoos, charitable organisations such as the Blue Cross, PDSA, RSPCA or Animal Health Trust, universities and the armed forces.</p>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>As a vocational degree, veterinary medicine equips you with the specialist knowledge and skills that qualify you to work as a vet straight after graduation. The degree covers all aspects of animal health and disease, as well as the legal, environmental and ethical issues relating to animal welfare and public health. You also learn the relevant business skills related to running a vet practice.</p>
<p>You also develop a range of other skills that are valued by employers, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to analyse and evaluation information</li>
<li>interpersonal and teamworking skills</li>
<li>oral and written communication skills</li>
<li>customer care</li>
<li>decision making ability</li>
<li>problem solving ability</li>
<li>project and time management skills</li>
<li>self-motivation and initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Some graduates choose to go on to postgraduate study in order to develop their knowledge in a specialist area such as small animal surgery or equine medicine, or to move into a specialist job, for example veterinary cardiologist. Courses can be undertaken full time or part time while working.</p>
<p>It's also possible to study for advanced professional qualifications while working. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, for example, offers the Certificate in Advanced Veterinary Practice (CertAVP) aimed at qualified vets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ANTHROPOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>A degree in anthropology covers the cultural and biological diversity of humans. The broad discipline you'll gain from studying both science and the humanities could lead to a variety of careers.</p>

<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>Gaining work experience is vital when starting out in most careers and shows commitment to a future employer. Take a proactive approach and find opportunities in which you can build up a desirable range of skills such as communication, planning, and project management.</p>
<p>Look for opportunities that are relevant to the area in which you wish to work. For example, if you want to get into charity or international aid roles, there are many opportunities for you to volunteer overseas in your summer break.</p>
<p>Involvement in a student society can help you develop relevant skills and experience in, for example, publicity, campaigning, and public speaking.</p>
<p>Try contacting local council offices or museums and galleries for information about project activities and ask if they need volunteers to help out with the organisation or running of events.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Only a tiny proportion of graduates become anthropologists, as academics or researchers. Some choose careers that build directly on anthropology, including social policy and teaching, development/overseas agencies and work for non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>

For example, if you would like to work as an economist, you may want to consider applying for a place on the&nbsp;Government Economic Service (GES)&nbsp;summer scheme. You will need to be in your penultimate year and have a predicted grade of a 2.1 or first.</p>
<p>Individual government departments may also be able to offer work experience and you should contact the department directly to find out more.</p>
<p>You could also consider work experience or work shadowing in areas such as accountancy, banking or finance. Contact local employers to see if they can help you.</p>
<p>Any work experience is useful as it allows you to build essential skills in a variety of areas including teamworking, communication and time management. Contact local volunteering or charity organisations such as&nbsp;Do-it&nbsp;for volunteering opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>

<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>Postgraduate training and study is a requirement to become a chartered psychologist. Due to course entry requirements, many psychology graduates spend a year or more getting work experience before embarking on postgraduate study.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to build up your work experience as soon as you can. You will usually need to work on a voluntary basis first to get enough experience to apply for a paid job.</p>
<p>The type of experience needed depends on the area of psychology you're interested in. Work as an assistant psychologist or in areas such as nursing, social work, mental health work, services for individuals with disabilities, mentoring young offenders and work in prisons, probation or social services is vital.</p>
<p>Experience as a research assistant is also relevant.</p>
<p>For educational psychology, experience of working with children in educational, childcare, or community settings is required. Although not essential, experience as a teacher is useful.</p>
<p>Experience in personnel or human resources and business and management is needed for those interested in occupational psychology.</p>
<p>Many psychology graduates choose to enter other career areas. Again, work or voluntary experience in your chosen field is important. This can include part-time work during your degree, summer placements and internships, as well as voluntary work and work shadowing.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Although some psychology graduates become professional psychologists, many go on to work in related fields.</p>

<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>Work experience will help you to decide which area of nutrition you want to concentrate on, as well as giving you valuable experience and contacts. For public health or community education, any community work, whether nutrition-related or not, will help develop your skills.</p>
<p>To work in international aid, you'll need experience in a voluntary organisation (UK or overseas), such as the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) programme.</p>
<p>Hospitals and NHS Trusts often offer work experience, as do large pharmaceutical, food and sport and fitness companies. Businesses value any commercial experience - especially food-related work, such as hospitality and catering.</p>
<p>Whatever your future ambitions, it'll be useful for your career if you can get some experience of working in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors as you could end up working across all three.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>You could work for a multinational food manufacturer or retailer, or for a manufacturer of animal feeds. In international development, employers include government or non-government aid agencies and international charities. If you're looking for a career in sports nutrition, employers can include sport and leisure companies, sports clubs or sport professional associations.</p>
<p>In public health, typical employers include local authorities, government departments (such as the Department of Health or the Department for International Development) or the NHS. In community work, your employer is likely to be a voluntary organisation or a small not-for-profit community interest company.</p>
<p>For a career in research, you could work in a university, for a research body or for a large company. There are also opportunities to work as a self-employed nutritionist.</p>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>A nutrition degree develops your knowledge of the science of nutrients and their effects, as well as the social factors which influence nutrition. It covers food science, food production and physiology, as well as legislation, psychosocial issues and behaviour.</p>
<p>It also develops your skills in:</p>
<ul>
<li>rigorous scientific research</li>
<li>behaviour change and motivation</li>
<li>understanding the business environment</li>
<li>assessment</li>
<li>interpreting data</li>
<li>laboratory techniques</li>
<li>giving presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Some nutrition graduates choose to develop their interest or specialism with further study, either immediately after their degree or after working for a few years. A Masters in your chosen area, for example, public health, global health, sport or animal nutrition and feed, will help you become an expert in your field.</p>
<p>If your undergraduate degree wasn't accredited by the&nbsp;Association for Nutrition (AfN), you could choose to take an AfN-accredited Masters degree, which leads to eligibility to apply for direct entry to the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN).</p>
<p>To become a dietitian, you can study a two-year postgraduate course (either a Postgraduate Diploma or a Masters in dietetics) to meet the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) registration requirements.</p>

<li>Toxicologist</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>It's important to get relevant work experience to show potential employers that you're enthusiastic and that you can apply the skills you've learned during your course to the workplace.</p>
<p>Most retail chains offer summer placement programmes in community pharmacy lasting between six and eight weeks. Some employers will recruit their pre-registration trainees from these programmes.</p>
<p>You could find experience in a hospital pharmacy, although this may be unpaid work shadowing and last from a few days to a few weeks.</p>
<p>There may also be some opportunities to do a placement with a pharmaceutical company, depending on your areas of interest.</p>
<p>Experience in a retail environment or voluntary work in a healthcare setting will enable you to develop valuable skills, including customer or patient care, and will increase your knowledge of over-the-counter medications.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>The majority of community pharmacists in the UK work in large retail chains or independent pharmacies of various sizes. Others are employed by small or medium-sized chain stores, GP surgeries or health centres.</p>
<p>The majority of hospital pharmacists work for hospitals within the NHS. It's also possible to work for private hospitals.</p>
<p>Qualified pharmacists can work as locum (temporary replacement) pharmacists, either on a self-employed basis or through an agency.</p>
<p>Pharmacy graduates are also employed in industry by private sector organisations, such as pharmaceutical companies and food and drink companies, to work in areas such as research and development, quality assurance, marketing, sales and management.</p>
<p>Other types of employers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the armed services - you can work as a military pharmacist for the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force</li>
<li>universities and research institutions - for a career as an academic pharmacist</li>
<li>veterinary pharmacy practices - you can work as a veterinary pharmacist for specialist practices, university veterinary schools, the pharmaceutical industry, and government departments and agencies such as the Veterinary Medicines Directorate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>Studying pharmacy enables you to develop skills specific to the role of a pharmacist, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of facts and theories relating to the design and manufacture of medicines</li>
<li>the ability to communicate effectively with patients and other health professionals</li>
<li>production of pharmacy-specific scientific documentation</li>
<li>operation of pharmaceutical instrumentation</li>
<li>knowledge of the law and ethical concerns relating to the supply of medicines</li>
<li>analysis of medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also develop a broad range of skills that are attractive to employers in other sectors as well. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>interpersonal skills</li>
<li>the ability to work well as part of a team</li>
<li>numeracy and computation</li>
<li>problem-solving skills and the ability to think clearly and methodically</li>
<li>time management and organisational skills</li>
<li>commercial awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Only small numbers of pharmacy graduates go on to further study directly after graduation. This is because a pre-entry postgraduate qualification is not needed to practise as a pharmacist and is rarely advantageous when applying for jobs within the profession.</p>
<p>Pharmacy graduates who want a career in scientific research and development may study for an MSc or PhD in fields such as pharmacy, prescribing and drug discovery and development, or in biomedical or chemical sciences.</p>
<p>Graduates who decide that they want to pursue careers outside pharmacy may undertake a relevant vocational or postgraduate course to broaden their skills and increase their knowledge of other areas.</p>

<p>The armed forces also employ clinical physiologists. Further employment opportunities can be found with scientific publishers, educational settings such as secondary schools or colleges - as a science teacher, and with scientific sales and marketing companies.</p>
<p>Non-scientific employers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>management consultancies</li>
<li>law and accountancy firms</li>
<li>banks and other financial institutions</li>
<li>retail companies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>Studying physiology helps you develop skills in planning, conducting/evaluating experiments, and researching and interpreting scientific literature. You also develop the ability to communicate science to both peers and non-scientists.</p>
<p>You gain a wide range of skills sought by both scientific and non-scientific employers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>analytical and problem-solving</li>
<li>using judgement, decision-making and questioning</li>
<li>the ability to identify, select, organise and communicate information and data</li>
<li>computing, statistics and numeracy</li>
<li>attention to detail</li>
<li>planning, organisation and time management</li>
<li>teamworking and collaborating between groups</li>
<li>persistence and resilience to retry experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Some graduates choose to undertake a second undergraduate degree, such as medicine or dentistry. There are graduate fast-track courses available at some UK universities.</p>
<p>Some go on to become clinical scientists by undertaking further training and study on the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP).</p>
<p>Others pursue a postgraduate qualification such as an MSc, MRes or PhD in physiology. In academia, a PhD is generally required to obtain a lectureship. In industry, some large employers, such as major pharmaceutical companies, may sponsor a relevant part-time Masters or PhD.</p>
<p>It's also possible to move away from pure physiology by studying an MSc or diploma in related subjects such as forensic science or toxicology. Or, you could opt to change career direction by studying something different, such as law or computing.</p>

<p><strong>MEDICAL REHABILITATION </strong></p>
<p>Specialists in rehabilitation medicine (RM) work closely with many other medical specialties, healthcare professionals and other agencies to assess and provide interventions to individuals with complex disabling conditions. The aim is to optimise recovery after severe injuries in the acute phase and improve function and promote participation in society in the longer term for all people with conditions which give rise to disability.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of the work</strong></p>
<p>Neurorehabilitation encompasses patients with traumatic brain injury,&nbsp;stroke&nbsp;and progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury rehabilitation for patients with acute or progressive spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>Musculoskeletal medicine includes a wide range of chronic conditions. Limb loss medicine includes a large proportion of patients with widespread vascular disease, or who have congenital limb abnormalities. Some conditions such as cerebral palsy have a combination of neurological and musculoskeletal problems.</p>
<p>Working with such a varied group of patients demands highly developed diagnostic abilities. Skills in managing both acute and chronic complications are essential. Rehabilitation physicians have the advantage of developing the &lsquo;long view&rsquo;, managing patients for months or even years from soon after an acute event, through to discharge and ongoing rehabilitation in the community.</p>
<p>This gives the opportunity to get to know the patient and their family and so deliver holistic care.</p>
<p><strong><em>Current trends in rehabilitation medicine include interfacing with acute services and other specialties such as:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>hyper-acute rehabilitation &ndash;taking patients directly from critical care services</li>
<li>major trauma rehabilitation and rehabilitation along the acute care pathway</li>
<li>working in the assessment and management of patients with disorders of consciousness (PDoC)</li>
<li>closer working relationships between neurological rehabilitation and other services including spinal cord injuries centres, clinical neurosciences, stroke medicine etc</li>
<li>developing skills in the management of chronic pain</li>
<li>working with palliative care teams to support end of life care in patients with complex disability</li>
<li>interactions with the courts for medico-legal issues including litigation and mental capacity -best interests decision-making, deprivation of liberty etc</li>
<li>further differentiation of specific fields of interest within the specialty including further development of musculoskeletal rehabilitation and increased focus on vocational rehabilitation</li>
<li>further development of community-based specialist services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Common procedures/interventions</em></strong></p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>specialist rehabilitation prescriptions for patients in the acute care pathways</li>
<li>practical procedures to reduce pain, spasticity, and other impairments</li>
<li>assessing patients for complex assistive technologies such as specialist wheelchair seating</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Areas of specialist interest</strong></p>
<p>Many doctors in rehabilitation medicine develop areas of specialist interest such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>neurological rehabilitation</li>
<li>spinal cord injury rehabilitation</li>

<p><strong>FINE ART</strong></p>
<p>Fine art graduates develop a range of practical and creative skills as well as gain valuable experience of entering exhibitions, competitions and building up a portfolio of work</p>
<p><strong>Job options</strong></p>
<p>Jobs directly related to your degree include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial art gallery manager</li>
<li>Community arts worker</li>

<li>Museum/gallery exhibitions officer</li>
<li>Multimedia programmer</li>

<li>Stylist</li>
<li>Talent agent</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>Start building up a portfolio of work while you're an undergraduate. This should contain examples of your own ideas rather than just coursework. In addition, enter as many competitions and exhibitions as possible and begin to get your work known.</p>
<p>Networking and making contacts is highly advantageous, as they may be able to offer (or help you secure) commissions. If friends or family ask you to produce work for them, this can be included in your portfolio and in the list of commissions on your CV.</p>
<p>Voluntary work with community art initiatives, for example, can be valuable. You may find paid art-related employment while studying, through projects at summer camps and activity centres for young people.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Finding jobs in this sector is not always straightforward. Short-term possibilities are available on a competitive basis and are a means of becoming established. Roles include artist in residence, developing art-related activities in schools, hospitals and prisons, or bidding for fixed-term funding to carry out a particular project or commission. Many fine artists produce and market their own work.</p>
<p>You can diversify by taking courses in art-related disciplines, such as graphics or teaching, or become a 'portfolio' worker, holding down several jobs to support your creative work.</p>
<p>You can also apply for mainstream graduate jobs and training in a range of industries, such as banking, insurance, media and public relations.</p>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>As well as developing practical and creative techniques in a range of media, a fine art degree gives you skills in using different types of equipment and processes from hand tools and welding gear to digitisation.</p>
<p>Employers value the transferable skills you acquire, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to develop individual ideas and collaborate with others</li>
<li>strong observational, research and analytical skills</li>
<li>creative problem solving</li>
<li>the ability to learn from criticism and be objective about your work</li>
<li>an openness to new influences and concepts</li>
<li>entrepreneurial skills in marketing your work and possibly setting up a business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through showing your work at competitions and exhibitions, you also gain experience in working to briefs, organising your work and meeting deadlines, displaying work to advantage, lighting, marketing and event management.</p>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Some fine art graduates move on to a Masters degree in different creative subjects, such as illustration or art conservation, if their portfolio demonstrates an aptitude for this. Other MAs provide grounding in related areas, such as arts management, history of art and art therapy.</p>
<p>The Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) enables fine artists to teach in a variety of settings. Shorter-term courses can develop skills that enhance or supplement expertise in particular areas or materials, such as glass blowing or metal working.</p>

<p>Some universities provide opportunities to take a work placement during your course, either in the UK or abroad, or to learn an additional language.</p>
<p>For those interested in training to become a speech and language therapist, getting some work experience is essential. Try and arrange an observation session at your local speech and language therapy service and get some experience working with children and adults with a learning disability or the elderly and disabled people.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Graduate jobs are typically available in areas such as communications, public relations and marketing.</p>
<p>A degree in linguistics is useful for teaching abroad, publishing roles and roles in government administration.</p>
<p>Linguistics graduates also go into jobs where they can use their knowledge of linguistics directly, such as working for dictionary compilers or as proofreaders and editors.</p>
<p>Others train as speech and language therapists or as teachers, or find work teaching English as a foreign or second language. There are also opportunities in computer programming and information technology.</p>
<p>Typical employers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>media organisations</li>
<li>publishing companies</li>
<li>marketing and PR companies</li>
<li>Civil Service, especially on the Fast Stream</li>

<li>primary and secondary schools</li>
<li>language schools both in the UK and abroad</li>
<li>the NHS and private hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>Studying linguistics teaches you about the science of language and how it evolves. You develop skills in transcribing and analysing language and understanding and critiquing theories and ideas. In addition, you learn how to present linguistic data in various formats.</p>
<p>You also develop other important skills, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>research skills, including knowledge of research methodology and quantitative methods</li>
<li>a range of analysis and statistical analysis techniques</li>
<li>the ability to accurately collect, interpret and manage data</li>

<ul>
<li>applied linguistics</li>
<li>forensic linguistics</li>
<li>language sciences</li>
</ul>
<p>or a related area such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>English language</li>
<li>philosophy of language</li>
<li>creative writing</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Others go on to postgraduate study in order to enter a particular career such as speech and language therapy or teaching. There are also opportunities to take a qualification in teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL).</p>
<p>Although it's not essential to do a postgraduate qualification for careers in areas such as HR, journalism, IT and social research, further vocational study may enhance your chances of employment, particularly when combined with relevant work experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING</strong></p>
<p>Marketing is a popular graduate career, particularly in the developing digital and social media areas, but entry is extremely competitive so you'll need to build your marketing experience</p>
<p><strong>Job options</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Remember that many employers accept applications from graduates with any degree subject, so don't restrict your thinking to the jobs listed here.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>Due to the nature of the marketing sector, any skills and contacts you build up outside your studies can give you a real advantage.</p>
<p>If your course involves a work placement or internship, use it to make contacts in marketing departments and develop your practical marketing skills. Showing initiative at this stage could really pay off in the future.</p>
<p>You can develop good communication and project management skills that you'll need for a marketing role through organising society or department events, writing newsletters, managing budgets and standing on committees. You can also help your application by showing how you developed organisation and time-management skills through combining studies, social life and part-time work.</p>
<p>Your interests can also offer a way into a marketing career - for example, if you're passionate about sport, the environment or music, one of these could become your specialist area.</p>
<p>Consider marketing or publicity roles in dedicated organisations. For instance, charities, sports or arts organisations may value your drive and commitment to the area even if you don't have marketing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>Specialist marketing, advertising and PR agencies are not the only major employers of marketing graduates.</p>
<p>Marketing is a core element of all organisations and, therefore, opportunities exist across all industry sectors - private, public and voluntary. These can range from the financial, consumer and information technology industries to not-for-profit organisations, such as charities, local government and higher education institutions. Most companies use traditional marketing methods alongside developing digital and social media channels.</p>
<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>A marketing degree helps you develop the ability to anticipate customer demand, identify target markets and communicate effectively with them. You explore areas such as customer behaviour and psychology, business management, human resources and culture, as well as how consumers' use of IT and digital media impacts on marketing.</p>
<p>You also develop an essential range of transferable business skills, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to express yourself clearly, both verbally and in writing</li>
<li>advanced planning and strategic thinking</li>
<li>research, analysis and presentation skills</li>
<li>the ability to use your own initiative and think creatively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduates from some courses will be eligible for exemptions from some modules of professional qualifications provided by the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM).</p>
<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Postgraduate courses in marketing tend to fall under the remit of business schools and will usually focus on a more theoretical understanding of marketing, such as customer psychology, strategy and branding, as well as covering areas such as international marketing and digital marketing. Although these types of qualifications can be helpful for graduates in non-business subjects, they're not essential.</p>
<p>You may also want to consider management degree courses that include marketing as part of a wider curriculum.</p>
<p>A range of vocational certificates and diplomas in marketing are provided by&nbsp;The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM). They range from foundation through to postgraduate level.</p>

<p><strong>MASS COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p>Communication as we used to know it, has changed phenomenally and continues to evolve. Communication technology and media now transcends physical limits and boundaries and graduates of mass communication have it all to do in using their imagination and exploiting the ever-expanding career opportunities now made possible.</p>
<p>Mass communication is the study of how people exchange information through mass media to large segments of the population at the same time. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood to relate newspaper, magazine, and book publishing, as well as radio, television and film, even via internet as these mediums are used for disseminating information, news and advertising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as interpersonal communication or organizational communication, in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the behavior, attitude, opinion, or emotion of the person or people receiving the information.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Mass Communication</strong></p>
<p>Mass Communication is not limited to journalism alone as many would erroneously think. To a great extent mass media is a modern reality which covers all aspects of human life. Moreover, a great change can be observed in the concept of people working in mass media. Careers in Mass Communication can be high paying but also bring in a great deal of job satisfaction and expression of creativity.</p>
<p>The one major challenge that graduates of Mass Communication have to contend with is that unlike what was previously obtainable, people no longer require a degree in journalism, mass communication or any other mass media field to compete as the democratisation of media technology and online platforms have totally changed the game.</p>
<p><strong>Skills and Competencies that You Might Need</strong></p>
<p>As a mass communicator here are a few of the skills you will need to acquire as a foundation to rising as far as you can in any chosen job or career related to the use of mass media both old and new.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbal/written communication ability</li>
<li>Persuasive/Negotiation skills</li>
<li>Idea Evaluation</li>
<li>Accuracy and Attention to details (these days a little mistake can be amplified by the viral effect of mass media)</li>
<li>Research skills</li>
<li>Analytical skills</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Public speaking skills</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Career Opportunities for Mass Communication Graduates</strong></p>
<p>Mass media (which is what mass communication works with) has little boundaries. It is used to describe media platforms and channels that can be used for widespread communication and audience engagement. No longer are the radio and TV the major mass media used by mass communicators. The internet and mobile platforms along with all other new media have changed the definition and scope of mass media forever.</p>
<p>Social media has created new opportunities that were not available few years ago. Opportunities like social media management, social media influencers, vlogging allows you to even start something on your own.</p>
<p>For you a graduate of mass communication desperate to know what possible options of lucrative careers you can pursue your imagination is the only limitation you may have. See below a snippet of careers and jobs you can do as a Mass Communication under various Industries;</p>

Work experience and networking are the most effective ways of opening doors to the right opportunities, so start making contacts early to give yourself the best chance of success.</p>

<p><strong>Work experience</strong></p>
<p>If you want to do a PGCE or equivalent postgraduate qualification, you'll need to have experience of working with children, preferably in a school environment.

<p>Volunteering to help out at a local education, sports, community or youth centre is also a good way to gain some experience around educational issues.</p>
<p>To move away from a career in education, think about what areas of work interest you and carry out research into relevant roles and sectors. Use tools such as&nbsp;Job Match&nbsp;to help you decide what type of career you'd be suited to.</p>
<p>Look out for work placements and voluntary opportunities advertised via your university career service, on company websites and through the specialist press. Use these opportunities to discover whether you suit the work and to build up a network of contacts. Work shadowing is another useful way of finding out about a particular career.</p>
<p><strong>Typical employers</strong></p>
<p>If you're working in a state-maintained school, your employer will often be your local authority. However, you may be employed directly by the school; if for example, you work for an academy, free school or independent school. You'll also be employed directly by the institution if you work for a college. Other employers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>central government departments</li>
<li>community and voluntary organisations</li>
<li>museums</li>
<li>the police and probation services</li>

<p><strong>Skills for your CV</strong></p>
<p>Studying education develops specific skills relating to a range of educational topics, including theories of learning, equality and diversity, education policy and practice, and creativity and education.</p>
<p>Your degree will also provide you with a good general understanding of education in social, political and economic contexts. Some courses include work placement modules, providing the opportunity to put theory into practice.</p>

<p><strong>Further study</strong></p>
<p>Achieving Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) through completion of the PGCE (PGDE in Scotland) or equivalent postgraduate qualification is a popular route for education graduates.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to take a Masters course in education or a related social science in order to develop your understanding of the theory, research and policy of education and to enhance your professional knowledge, skills and practice. Some education graduates go on to study for a PhD in education. Another option is the Masters in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).</p>
