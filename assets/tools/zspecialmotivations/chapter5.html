        <p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>"To be successful you must accept all challenges that come your way. You can't just accept the ones you like." --Mike Gafka</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When was the last time worry ever solved a problem? Breathe and know that you are perfect in this moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adversity is but a gentle hand to shape you into something greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adversity could be the greatest gift in our life, in retrospect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A person of power embraces challenges in complete gratitude. No matter the situation life may bring, discontent is never justified, rather all is experienced as an opportunity and a privilege to adventure and grow." - James Ray</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Real difficulties can be overcome; it is only the imaginary ones that are unconquerable." --Theodore N. Vail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Never measure the height of a mountain until you have reached the top. Then you will see how low it was." - Dag Hammarskjold. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by your challenges, there is always a way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals." --Booker T. Washington</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's a sign of troubled times when the concept of 'pressure' becomes an acceptable excuse for ethical shortcuts. Pressures are just temptations in disguise and it's never been acceptable to give in to temptation." - Michael Josephson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Obstacles can't stop you. Problems can't stop you. Most of all, other people can't stop you. Only you can stop you." - Jeffrey Gitomer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Even the most daring and accomplished people have undergone tremendous difficulty. In fact, the more successful they became, the more they attributed their success to the lessons learned during their most difficult times." - Barbara Rose</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them. You will find that they haven't half the strength you think they have." - Norman Vincent Peale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome." - Samuel Johnson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"While no road is ever straight, dedication and persistence will always lead you to your dreams." - Arte Moreno</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them." - Orison Swett Marden</p>
