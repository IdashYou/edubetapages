<p>Change your thoughts and you'll change your world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"By your thoughts you are daily, even hourly, building your life; you are carving your destiny." -Ruth Barrick Golden</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you want your life to be more rewarding, you have to change the way you think." - Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change is inevitable and those who adapt quickly are most likely to succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A fresh mind keeps the body fresh. Take in the ideas of the day, drain off those of yesterday. As to the morrow, time enough to consider it when it becomes today." - Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Learn to smile at every situation. See it as an opportunity to prove your strength and ability." - Joe Brown</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Make it a point to rid your speech and thoughts of all forms of negative self-talk." - Karl Albrecht</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't worry yourself out of a bad situation, but you can believe yourself out of it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Believe in yourself and there will come a day when others will have no choice but to believe with you." - Cynthia Kersey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People who consider themselves victims of their circumstances will always remain victims unless they develop a greater vision for their lives." - Stedman Graham</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't fight a problem, solve it!" - Millard Fuller</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Champions aren't made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them - a desire, a dream, a vision." - Muhammad Ali</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think what I represent is achieving what you want in life. It's a matter of your attitude. Some people have a negative attitude, and that's their disability." - Marla Runyan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People underestimate their capacity for change. There is never a right time to do a difficult</p>
<p>thing." - John Porter</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." --Anonymous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds you plant." - Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done." --Vince Lombardi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change your beliefs and you&rsquo;ll change your thoughts. Change your thoughts and you&rsquo;ll change your habits. Change your habits and your life opens to unlimited possibility.</p>
