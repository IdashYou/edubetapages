        <p><strong>BALANCE</strong></p>
<p>"People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily." - Zig Ziglar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Slow down and enjoy life. It's not only the scenery you miss by going too fast, you also miss the sense of where you are going and why." - Eddie Cantor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You were intended not only to work, but to rest, laugh, play, and have proper leisure and enjoyment." - Grenville Kleiser</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Every good thing flows from the attitude of respect. For this reason, the most important action you can perform is to welcome yourself and others with respect and love." - Baba Muktananda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Start by doing what's necessary, then what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible." - St. Francis of Assisi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The truest greatness lies in being kind, the truest wisdom in a happy mind." - Ella Wheeler Wilcox</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"To listen is to know for a moment. To hear is to know forever." - Dana Cowley</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Words are nothing but words; power lies in deeds. Be a person of action." - Mali Oriot Mamadu Konyate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I May not know all the keys to success, but the key to failure is to try to please everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control." - Leo Buscaglia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Happiness is to be found along the way, not at the end of the road, for then the journey is over and it is too late. Today, this hour, this minute is the day, the hour, the minute for each of us to sense the fact that life is good, with all of its trials and troubles, and perhaps more interesting because of them." - Robert R. Updegraff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is ever unfolding from within, and revealing itself to the light, and thoughts engendered in the heart at last reveal themselves in words, actions, and things accomplished. As the fountain from a hidden spring, so flows forth a man's life from the secret recesses of his heart." - James Allen</p>
