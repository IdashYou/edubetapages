  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The digestive system consists of organs that break down food and absorb nutrients such as glucose.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><em><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Digestive system has two main parts;</span></em></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Digestive canal:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">This canal is formed with mouth aperture, mouth cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, ileum, rectum and anus.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The Digestive glands:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">In main salivary glands, liver and pancreas work as digestive glands.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Digestion in Mammals</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The digestive system includes organs from the mouth to the anus. Mammals starts their digestion in the mouth. Saliva in the mouth contains an enzyme Ptyalin, which digests starch converting it into complex sugars for further digestion.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Stomach</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The stomach is a sac-like organ in which food is further digested both mechanically and chemically. Churning movements of the stomach&rsquo;s thick, muscular walls complete the mechanical breakdown of food. The churning movements also mix food with digestive fluids secreted by the stomach. One of these fluids is hydrochloric acid. It kills bacteria in food and gives the stomach the low pH needed by digestive enzymes that work in the stomach. The main enzyme is pepsin, which chemically digests protein. When the small intestine is empty, a sphincter opens to allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Digestion and Absorption: The Small Intestine</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The small intestine is a narrow tube, it is the site of most chemical digestion and virtually all absorption. The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The liver is an organ of both digestion and excretion. It produces a fluid called bile, which is secreted into the duodenum. Some bile also goes to the gall bladder, a sac-like organ that stores and concentrates bile and then secretes it into the small intestine. In the duodenum, bile breaks up large globules of lipids into smaller globules that are easier for enzymes to break down. Bile also reduces the acidity of food entering from the highly acidic stomach.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">This is important because digestive enzymes that work in the duodenum need a neutral environment. The pancreas contributes to the neutral environment by secreting bicarbonate, a basic substance that neutralizes acid.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The Large Intestine and Its Functions&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">From the small intestine, any remaining food wastes pass into the large intestine. The large intestine is a relatively wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. Like the small intestine, the large intestine also consists of three parts: the cecum (or caecum), colon, and rectum.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">As they pass through the colon, which is the second part of the large intestine, excess water is absorbed. The remaining solid wastes are called feces. Feces accumulate in the rectum, which is the third part of the large intestine. As the rectum fills, the feces become compacted. After a certain amount of feces accumulate, they are eliminated from the body. A sphincter controls the anus and opens to let feces pass through.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">NB</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">: Pepsin is an enzyme in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins by splitting them into peptones (see peptidase). It is produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on pepsinogen, which is secreted by the gastric glands, where it helps digest the proteins in food.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The production of pancreatic hormones, including insulin, somatostatin, gastrin, and glucagon, play an important role in maintaining sugar and salt balance in our bodies. Primary hormones secreted by the pancreas include: Gastrin: This hormone aids digestion by stimulating certain cells in the stomach to produce acid.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The small intestine is the part of the gastrointestinal tract between the stomach and the large intestine where much of the digestion of food takes place. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals found in food.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Bile is a digestive compound produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder that causes lips (fats and oils) to break down or be emulsified into tiny, microscopic droplets.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The Gizzard of birds contains sands and other structures which help in grinding during digestion since they lack teeth.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The pharynx (throat) is involved in both digestion and respiration. It receives food and air from the mouth, and air from the nasal cavities. When food enters the pharynx, involuntary muscle contractions close off the air passageways.</span></p>
