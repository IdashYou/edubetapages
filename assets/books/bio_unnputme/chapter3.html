There are seven activities which make organisms different from
non-living things. These are the seven characteristics of living
organisms. <br /> <br />
<b> 1 Nutrition </b>
Living things take in materials from their surroundings that they
use for growth or to provide energy. Nutrition is the process by
which organisms obtain energy and raw materials from nutrients
such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats.<br /> <br />
<b> 2 Respiration </b>
Respiration is the release of energy from food substances in all
living cells. Living things break down food within their cells to
release energy for carrying out the following processes.<br /> <br />
<b> 3 Movement</b>
All living things move. It is very obvious that a leopard moves but
what about the thorn tree it sits in? Plants too move in various
different ways. The movement may be so slow that it is very
difficult to see.<br /> <br />
<b>4 Excretion </b>
All living things excrete. As a result of the many chemical
reactions occurring in cells, they have to get rid of waste products
which might poison the cells. Excretion is defined as the removal of
toxic materials, the waste products of metabolism and substances
in excess from the body of an organism.<br /> <br />
<b> 5 Growth</b>
Growth is seen in all living things. It involves using food to
produce new cells. The permanent increase in cell number and size
is called growth. <br /> <br />
<b> 6 Reproduction</b>
All living organisms have the ability to produce offspring. <br /> <br />
<b> 7 Sensitivity</b>
All living things are able to sense and respond to stimuli around
them such as light, temperature, water, gravity and chemical
substances.<br /> <br />

Learn these seven characteristics of living organisms. They form
the basis of the study of Biology. Each one of these characteristics
will be studied in detail during the course. Whilst many other
things carry out one or more of the above processes, only living
organisms possess all of these characteristics.
