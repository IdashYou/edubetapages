    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Organic evolution is the series of gradual changes which living organisms had undergone in response to changes in an environment since the beginning of time.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Many plants and animals have become extinct with the waning of time. Dinosaurs became extinct thousands of years back. Some other organisms are still surviving by slowly adapting them with little changes.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Lamarck&rsquo;s theory is called the theory of use and disuse</span></strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">His theory of evolution is based on the principle that acquired traits or physical changes in organisms during their lifetime-such as greater development of an organ or a part through use and disuse-could be transmitted to their offspring. Lamarck&rsquo;s theory also states that great changes in environment result in corresponding changes in species.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Darwin&rsquo;s theory is the theory of natural selection</span></strong></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">It states that species produce offspring in large number which result in competition among them which result in the survival of the fittest.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Convergent evolution means the process whereby organisms that are not closely related, independently evolve similar traits or structures as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches. These structures perform the same function but have different structural organization. Examples of convergent evolution are wings of butterflies and birds, fins of fishes and whales&rsquo; flippers.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Contrarily, divergent evolution means the evolutionary process whereby groups from the same common ancestor evolve and accumulate differences, resulting in the formation of new species, which might be as a result of the availability of new niche or changes in the environment. Example can be found in comparing turtle and tortoise.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A Diastema is a wide gap that separates rows of teeth mostly in herbivore. In plant-eating mammals like goat, the diastema separates the biting teeth at the front of the jaw, from the chewing teeth at the rear. This is an evolution change, the herbivores during evolution, stopped consuming meat and depending entirely on plants for their energy requirements. Since, they no longer require the services of canine tooth for piercing and tearing into meat or flesh.</span></p>
