  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">CIRCULATORY SYSTEM</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Open circulatory system: primarily found in invertebrates. Here, the blood flows freely through cavities and there are no vessels to conduct the blood.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Closed circulatory system: is found in vertebrates and a few invertebrates like earthworms. This system has the presence of vessels that conduct blood throughout the body.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein complex that circulates in the blood of vertebrates. During tissue and vascular injury, it is converted enzymatically by thrombin to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot. Fibrin clots function primarily to occlude blood vessels to stop bleeding.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Matured red blood cells (erythrocytes) lacks nucleus. As red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells. Because of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA, and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Red blood cells (Erythrocytes) are formed in the red bone marrow of bones. Stem cells in the red bone marrow called hemocytoblasts give rise to all of the formed elements in blood. If a hemocytoblast commits to becoming a cell called a proerythroblast, it will develop into a new red blood cell.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Plasma is the liquid component of blood, in which the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are suspended. It constitutes more than half of the blood&#39;s volume and consists mostly of water that contains dissolved salts (electrolytes) and proteins. The major protein in plasma is albumin.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Agglutination is the process that occurs if an antigen is mixed with its corresponding antibody called isoagglutinin. This term is commonly used in blood grouping.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">When an Rh- woman conceives a child with an Rh+ man, their child can be Rh- or Rh+. If the baby&#39;s blood type matches the mother&#39;s (both are Rh-), Rh causes no complications. This may not be the case however, if the baby&#39;s blood type is Rh+.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Problems arise when the baby&rsquo;s Rh+ blood gets into the mother&rsquo;s Rh- bloodstream by traveling through the placenta. Red blood cells with the Rh factor are foreign to the mother. In an attempt to fight off this foreign invader, her immune system produces antibodies against the Rh+ blood cells. The process is called sensitization &mdash; the mother is now sensitized to the Rh factor.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">People with blood group O are general donors. Recipients with blood type AB can receive a blood or kidney from blood types A, B, AB and O. This implies that recipients with AB blood are compatible with any other blood type. AB is the universal recipient. People with blood group A can only receive blood from a person with blood group A, also people with blood group B can only receive blood from a person with blood group B.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The spleen is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. The spleen plays important roles in regards to red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The lymph system maintains the body&#39;s fluid balance and fights infections. The lymph is a colourless fluid containing white blood cells, which bathes the tissues and drains through the lymphatic system into the blood stream. The main role of lymphatic system is to return amino acids and excess interstitial or extracellular fluid (containing oxygen, glucose, amino acids, and other nutrients needed by tissue cells) to the blood stream. It also functions in the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (Vit A, D, E, K) from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous system to return them for circulation.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Amphibians have a three-chambered heart - two atria and one ventricle. The mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is kept to a minimum due to the timing of the contractions between the atria. This is called an incomplete double circulatory system.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Just like mammals, Birds carry out double circulation and have their heart divided into four chambers. Two upper thin-walled auricles and two lower thick-walled ventricles.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
