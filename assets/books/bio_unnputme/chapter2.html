    <strong> KINGDOM CLASSIFICATION </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Classification is an act of grouping things together on the basis of features 
    they have in cannon. The science of classification is called<em><u> Taxonomy</u></em>.
    <br />
    <strong><u>TAXONOMY</u></strong>
    <br />
    The science of taxonomy has two branches;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The naming of organisms otherwise known as Nomenclature </li>
    <li>The placing of organism into group or Systematic.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The latter is done on the basis of their similarities and difference.
    <br />
    Biological nomenclature is based on the <em><u>binomial system</u></em> 
    pioneered by the work of the Swedish naturalist <em><u>Carl Linnaeus (1707-78).
    </u></em>
</p>
<p>
    In this system, each organism has two Latin name: a generic name beginning with 
    a letter and a specific name beginning with a lower case letter. For example, 
    humans are named <em>Homo</em> <em>sapiens</em>; the genus is <em>Homo</em> and 
    the species is <em>sapiens.</em> Italics are used to indicate Latin names. 
    Alternatively, the words can be underlined e.g <u>Homo</u> <u>sapiens</u></p>
<p>
    <u>The Taxonomic Hierarchy </u>
    <br />
    Linnaeus eventually extended the binomial system to include more groups than 
    just genus and species. It is arranged from largest group to a smaller group e.g<br />
    Kingdom
    <br />
    Phylum (for animals)/ division (for plants)
    <br />
    Class
    <br />
    Order
    <br />
    Family<br />
    Genus<br />
    Species
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Species: Can be defined as a group of closely related organisms which are 
    capable of interbreeding to produce fertile offspring occasionally, two 
    organisms which are genetically closely related can interbred to produce 
    infertile offspring. A cross (hybrid) between a donkey and a horse, produce a 
    male, which is in fertile.
    <br />
    There are two types of classification;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Artificial </li>
    <li>Natural </li>
</ol>
<p>
    An artificial classification is based on one or a few easily observed 
    characteristics.<br />
    A natural classification tries to use natural relationship between organisms. It 
    considers more evidence than artificial classifications including internal as 
    well as external features.
    <br />
    Similarities of embryology, morphology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell 
    structure and behavior are all relevant. Most classification in use today are 
    natural and <u>phylogenetic</u>.
    <br />
    A phylogenetic classification is one based on evolutionary relationships. 
    Another type is <u>phonetic classification</u>. This avoids the problem of 
    establishing evolutionary relationships, which can be very difficult and very 
    controversial.
    <br />
    The use Of computers in taxonomy is known as <u>numerical taxonomy</u>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>FIVE KINGDOMS OF CLASSIFICATION</strong><br />
    The five-kingdom scheme was proposed by Whittaker (1969). Whittaker&#39;s scheme 
    consists of the:</p>
<ol>
    <li>kingdom – Monera</li>
    <li>kingdom - Protista</li>
    <li>kingdom – fungi</li>
    <li>kingdom – plantae</li>
    <li>kingdom – animalia</li>
</ol>
<p>
    N.B: the viruses do not fit into any of the five kingdoms because they are not 
    seen as true living things.</p>

<p>
    (i) KINGDOM MONERA
    <br />
    Organisms in this kingdom are very tiny and simple in-form. They are the 
    simplest micro-organisms. The body consist of one cell, the cell lacks a well 
    organized nucleus- no nuclear membrane, the nuclear materials just lie free in 
    the cell (hence monerans are called &quot;<u>prokaryotes</u>&quot;. The cell also lacks 
    mitochondria and plastid. However, it is enclosed by a rigid cell wall. 
    Reproduction is asexual by <u>binary fission or budding</u>. Examples of 
    monerans are the (a) bacteria and (b) blue-green algae.
</p>
<p>
    The bacteria are unicellular organisms of the phylum schizomycophyta. They show 
    various shapes. Some are autotrophic, others are saprophytic and parasitic. Some 
    bacteria are aerobic while others are anaerobic. They reproduce by binary 
    fission. The difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are shown below.
    <br />
    <strong><u>MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROKARYOTES AND EUKARYOTES</u></strong></p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Prokaryotes</u></strong>
    <br />
    The prokaryote is made up of organisms commonly known as Bacteria. They are 
    mainly single cells.</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Features of prokaryotes </u></strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Cell wall</strong>: The bacterial cell wall is strong and rigid due to 
        the present of <u>murein</u>, a molecule that consists of parallel 
        polysaccharides cross-linked at regular intervals by short chain of amino-acids.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cell membrane</strong>: the structure and functions of the cell surface 
        membrane are similar to those in eukaryotic cells. It is also the site of some 
        respiratory enzymes. In some bacteria, it forms <u>mesosomes</u> and/or 
        photosynthetic membranes. Mesosomes are folding of the cell surface membrane. 
        They appear to be associated with DNA during cell division.</li>
    <li><strong>Genetic materials</strong>: DNA is circular and lies free in the 
        cytoplasm (no true nucleus).</li>
    <li><strong>Ribosome</strong>: is the site of protein synthesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Capsules</strong>: capsules are slimy or gummy secretions of certain 
        bacteria which show up clearly after negatives staining. In some cases, these 
        secretions unite bacteria into colonies. They also enable bacteria to stick to 
        surface such as teeth, mud and rocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Spores</strong>: Some bacteria, mainly of the genera Clostridium and 
        Bacillus form endospores (spore produced inside cells). They are thick-walled, 
        long-lived and extremely resistant particularly to heat, drought and short-wave 
        radiations.</li>
    <li><strong>Flagella</strong>: Flagella of bacteria are simple, lacking 
        microtubules. It is 20nm in diameter. It is rigid and well shaped. It is used 
        for movement. Examples of bacteria with flagella are <u>Rhizobium</u> (one 
        flagellum), Azotobacter (many flagella) both of which are involved in the 
        nitrogen cycle; </li>
    <li>&nbsp;<strong>Pili (singular pilus): </strong>Projecting from the wall of some Gram 
        negative bacteria are numerous fine protein rods called <em>Pili</em> or 
        fimbriae. They are shorter and thinner than flagella and are concerned with 
        attachment to specific cells or surfaces. Various types occur, but of particular 
        interest is the <u>F.</u> <u>Pilus.</u> This involved in sexual reproduction.</li>
    <li><strong>Cell shape</strong>: bacterial shape is important aid to classification.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong><u>Form of Bacteria </u></strong>
    <br />
    1. Cocci:
    <br />
    (a)Streptococci (chain) e.g. <u>Streptococcus</u> <u>pneumonia</u>
    <br />
    (b) Staphylococci (like a Bunch of grapes) e.g. <u>Staphylococcus</u> <u>aureus</u>.
    <br />
    2. Bacilli: (single bacillus): rod-shaped e.g. <u>Escherichia</u> <u>coli</u>,
    <u>Salmonella</u> <u>typhi</u> (causes typhoid fever).<br />
    3. Spirilla (singular: spirillum) spiral- shaped e.g. <u>Treponema</u> <u>
    palladium</u> causes syphilis.
    <br />
    4. Vibrios (comma-shaped) e.g.<u> Vibrio</u> <u>cholera</u> causes cholera
</p>
<p>
    <strong>VIRUSES </strong>
    <br />
    Viruses were discovered in 1852, by a Russian botanist, D. l lvanovskyby 
    preparing an infectious extract from tobacco plants suffering from mosaic 
    disease.
    <br />
    <strong><u>Characteristics of virus </u></strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>They are the smallest living organisms. </li>
    <li>They do not have a cellular structure. </li>
    <li>They can only reproduce by invading living cells. Therefore, they are parasitic. 
        They are obligate endoparasites, meaning that they can only live parasitically 
        inside other cell. Outside the living cell, they form crystal and become 
        inactive. </li>
    <li>They have a simple structure consisting of a small piece of nucleic acid either 
        DNA or RNA, not both, surrounded by a protein or lipoprotein coat.</li>
    <li>They are the boundary between what we regard as living and non-living.</li>
    <li>Each type of virus recognizes and infects only certain type of cell. I.e. virus 
        is highly specific to their hosts. </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong><u>Structure of virus </u></strong>
    <br />
    Viruses have a very simple structure consisting of the following:
    <br />
    (i). <strong>Core:</strong> The genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The DNA or 
    RNA may be single-stranded or double -stranded.<br />
    (ii) &nbsp;<strong>Capsid:</strong> a protective coat of protein surrounding the 
    core.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Nucleocapsid</strong>: the combined structure formed by the core and 
        capsid. </li>
    <li><strong>Envelope:</strong> A few viruses such as the HIV and influenza viruses 
        have an additional lipoprotein layer around the capsid derived from the cell 
        surface membrane of the host cell. </li>
    <li><strong>Capsomeres</strong>: capsids are often built up of identical repeating 
        subunits called capsomeres. </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Viruses that attack bacteria form a group called <u>bacteriophages.</u><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <strong><u>HIV</u></strong><br />
    <strong>AIDS</strong> (Acquired Immune deficiency Syndrome) is caused by <strong>
    HIV</strong> (Human
    <br />
    Immunodeficiency Virus). HIV belongs to a group of RNA viruses known as <u>Retro 
    viruses.</u> This name comes from the fact that these viruses can convert their 
    RNA back into a DNA copy using an enzyme known as reverse <u>Transcriptase</u>. 
    Normally a section of DNA (gene) is copied to make RNA, a process called 
    transcription. Making DNA from RNA is therefore reverse transcription, and the 
    enzyme controlling it is called <u>Reverse transcriptase.</u></p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Kingdom Protista </u></strong>
    <br />
    Member of this kingdom are unicellular organisms but much larger than the 
    monerans. They are eukaryotes i.e. their nucleus is enclosed in a nuclear 
    membrane. Examples of Protista include Algae, Protozoa, Oomycota and slime 
    moulds. Better illustration is shown below.
    <br />
    (i) <strong><u>Algae:</u></strong> The algae form a large group of Protista of 
    great biological importance and significance to humans. The bodies of algae lack 
    true stems. roots and leaves. Such relatively undifferentiated body is called a
    <u>thallus</u>. Two examples of algae are namely chlorella (phylum chlorophyta) 
    and fucus (Phylum Phaeophyta).
    <br />
    <strong>(A) Phylum Chlorophyta (green algae).</strong><br />
    Chlorella is a unicellular non-motile green alga. In phylum chlorophyta (green 
    algae), the dominant photosynthetic pigment is chlorophyll; therefore green in 
    appearance. Chlorophyll is present (as in plants). They store carbohydrate as 
    starch (insoluble). They are mostly fresh water organism.<br />
    Example of chlorophyta includes chorella, chlorophyta, chlamydomonas, spirogyra, 
    ulva (e.t.c)<br />
    <strong>(B) Phylum Phaeophyta (brown algae) </strong>
    <br />
    Fucus is a relatively large and complex brown alga. In phaeophyta, dominant 
    photosynthetic pigment is brown and called fucoxanthin. They store carbohydrates 
    as soluble Linamarin<br />
    and Mannitol. They also store fat. Nearly all marine (fresh water genera only).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Morphological adaptation of brown algae</strong>. The thallus is firmly 
    anchored by a holdfast. This form an intimate association with its substrate, 
    usually rock, and is extremely difficult to dislodge.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Physiological adaptation:</strong> The dominant photosynthetic pigment 
    is the brown pigment fucoxanthin. This is an adaptation for photosynthesizing 
    under water because fucoxanthin strongly absorbs blue light which penetrates 
    water much further than longer wavelengths such as red light.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reproductive adaptation:</strong> Release of gametes is synchronized 
    with the tides. At low tide the thallus dries and squeezes the sex organs, which 
    are protected by mucilage out of the conceptacles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(2) PROTOZOA</strong><br />
    Protozoa are unicellular, animal- like protista with heterotrophic nutrition. 
    Most are free- living and they have various methods of locomotion. Some, 
    however, are parasites, including one (plasmodium) which causes malaria. 
    Examples of protozoa include amoeba, paramecium, Plasmodium, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PHYLUM PROTOZOA </strong>
    <br />
    They are microscopic, unicellular organisms. Members can be free living, 
    mutualistic or Parasitic. There are four main classes. The classification is 
    based on locomotory structures,
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong><u>Class Rhizopoda or Sarcodina</u></strong> e.g.(Amoeba, 
        Difflugia).These are the most primitive protozoans. Members have pseudopodia for 
        movement and feeding. Asexual reproduction is by binary fission. </li>
    <li><strong><u>Class mastigophora or flagellate</u></strong> (e.g. Euglena, 
        trypanosome. Noctiluca, volvox, chlamydomonas). Members possess one or more 
        flagella for movement at the adult stage. The body is covered by a firm pellicle 
        which gives the body a definite shape.</li>
    <li><strong><u>Class ciliophora or ciliata</u></strong>. (e.g. paramecium, opalina, 
        balantidium). Members possesses cilia as locomotory organs. There are usually 
        two types of nuclei the meganucleus and micronucleus. Sexual reproduction is by 
        conjugation.</li>
    <li><strong><u>Class sporozoa</u></strong> (e.g. plasmodium, Eimeria, monocysts). 
        Members lack pellicle, contractile vacuoles and locomotory organelles. They 
        reproduce sexually or asexually. </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
    <strong>Phylum cilliophora (ciliates) </strong>
    <br />
    Ciliate are type of protozoan. They have the following characteristic:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are unicellular, heterotrophic organisms.</li>
    <li>They posses <u>Cilia</u>, fine hairs which beat and cause movement of water, 
        either for locomotion or feeding. </li>
    <li>They are definite shape due to the presence of a thin, flexible outer region of 
        cytoplasm called the pellicle.</li>
    <li>They have a complex cell structure with a macronucleus and a micronucleus.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Example of ciliate is paramecium. It lives in stagnant water, or slow-flowing 
    fresh water that contains decay organic matter. Other example of ciliates are 
    Opalina and Balantidium. They have two fixed <u>contractile vacuoles</u> present 
    in the endoplasm. They are responsible for osmo-regulation. Their cells contain 
    two nuclei. The larger, bean-shape macronucleus is polyploid (has more than two 
    sets of chromosomes). It controls metabolic activities apart from reproduction. 
    The micronucleus is diploid. It controls reproduction and the formation of new 
    macronuclei during nuclear division. Paramecium can reproduce both asexually (by 
    transverse binary fission) and sexually (by conjugation).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Phylum apicomplexa </u></strong>
    <br />
    This group of protozoan also possesses a pellicle, giving the cell a definite 
    shape. Most however, possess no special shape for locomotion and have limited 
    movement. Their most distinguishing characteristic is the production of spores 
    during asexual and sexual reproduction. An example is the parasitic <u>
    plasmodium</u> which causes malaria in humans.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Kingdom Fungi </u></strong>
    <br />
    The fungi are a large and successful group of organisms of about 80,000 named 
    species. The range in size from the unicellular yeasts to the large toadstools, 
    puffballs and stinkhorns, and occupy a very wide range of habitats, both aquatic 
    and terrestrial.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Characteristics of fungi</u></strong><br />
    They exhibit heterotrophic nutrition because they lack chlorophyll and are 
    therefore non-photosynthetic. They can be parasites, saprotrophs or . 
    mutualists. Nutrition is absorptive; digestion takes place outside the body and 
    nutrients are absorbed directly. Digestion does not take place inside the body, 
    unlike animal. They have rigid cell walls that contain <u>chitin.</u> Body is 
    usually a mycelium, a network of fine tubular filaments called Hyphae these may 
    be septate (have cross walls) e.g. penicillium or Aseptate (no cross wall) e.g. 
    mucor. If carbohydrate is stored, it is usually as glycogen, not starch. 
    Reproduce by mean of spores. They are non-motile.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Classification of fungi</u></strong><br />
    The kingdom fungus is classified into three (3) phylum.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Phylum ZygomycotA</li>
    <li>Phylum Ascomycota</li>
    <li>Phylum Basidiomycota</li>
</ol>
<p>
    (Read up their features)</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>(4) KINGDOM PLANTAE </u></strong>
    <br />
    Plants are autotrophic eukaryotes which are adapted to grow on land. Plants are 
    photoautotrophic; meaning their source of energy is light. This method of 
    nutrition is called <u>photosynthesis.</u> Generally, plants can be grouped 
    into;</p>
<ol>
    <li>&nbsp;Non-vascular plants</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Vascular plants. </li>
    <li>Non-vascular plants: are plants that lack vascular bundles- xylem and phloem 
        e.g. bryophytes </li>
    <li>Vascular plants: Are plant that have vascular bundles. Example includes 
        filicinophyta (Ferns) coniferophyta (conifers), angiospermophyta (flowering 
        plants). </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong><u>Division bryophyte (liverworts and mosses</u>)</strong><br />
    Bryophytes are multicellular, non-flowering and non-vascular plants. They were 
    probably the first land plants that were not totally dependent on the aquatic 
    media for survival. Bryophytes have no true roots, stems and leaves but have 
    structure resembling these and so are more advanced than the algae and fungi. 
    Bryophytes show a clearly defined alternation of generation. The sporophyte is 
    always attached and dependent on the gametophyte.
    <br />
    They are thought to have evolved from green algae. The division contains two 
    main classes: the <u>hepaticae</u> or liverworts and mosses.<br />
    Bryophytes have no true vascular tissue (xylem or phloem). They lack true root, 
    being anchored by thin filaments called Rhizoids which grow from the stem. They 
    exhibit alternation of generations, in which the gametophyte generation is 
    dominant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Division Fllicinophyta (Ferns)</u></strong><br />
    The pteridophytes (filicinophytes) or the ferns are non flowering vascular 
    plants. They exhibit alternation of generations in which the sporophyte is 
    dominant. Gametophyte is reduced to a small, simple prothlllus. Typically, fern 
    leaves are coiled when young and unroll as they grow to form large mature 
    leaves. The stem of the fern has a protective epidermis and supporting vascular 
    tissue (xylem and phloem). Xylem and phloem bare concerned with translocation 
    (transport) of water and nutrients round the plant body. Xylem carries mainly 
    water and mineral salt, whereas phloem carries mainly organic solutes in 
    solution such as sugars. The sporophyte of fern is the persisting plant, 
    commonly recognized as the fern plant. The gametophyte is a heart shaped 
    structure which bears the sex organs in which eggs and male gametes or sperms 
    are produce. Unlike the bryophytes, the sporophytes and gametophytes of ferns 
    lead separate existences. Some common examples of ferns are Dryopteris, Adiantum 
    (maidenhair fern) and Nephrolepsis.

    <strong><u>THE SPERMATOPHYTA </u></strong>
    <br />
    The spermatophytes are the seed-producing vascular plants, having well developed 
    roots, stems, and leaves. The seeds have structures that enclose the embryo. The 
    sporophyte is the dominant generation, gametophyte generation is severely 
    reduced. The sporophyte produces two types of spores i.e. (heterosporous).The 
    two types are microspores and megaspores. Water is not needed for sexual 
    reproduction because male gametes do not swim.
    <br />
    The spermatophytes are divided into
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Gymnosperms</li>
    <li>Angiosperms </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>GYMNOSPERMS </strong>
    <br />
    The Gymnosperms are plants with naked seeds. They are non-flowering, 
    seed-producing vascular plants. They have true-roots, stems and leaves. The 
    leaves of most gymnosperms are characteristically tine needle-like structures or 
    tiny scale-like structures. The seeds of these plants are borne in special 
    structure called <u>cones</u>. The gymnosperms are more advance and better 
    adapted for terrestrial life than the ferns. <u>Cycas</u> and <u>Pinus</u> are 
    example of gymnosperms.</p>
<p>
    <strong>ANGIOSPERMOPHYTA (Flowering Plants)</strong><br />
    Angiosperms form the largest group in the plant kingdom. The angiosperms are 
    more highly evolved than the gymnosperms because they have an abundance of xylem 
    vessels and bear seeds which are projected within fruits. The angiosperm 
    consists of the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons.

    <strong><u>(5) KINGDOM ANlMALlA (ANIMALS)</u></strong>
    <br />
    The animal kingdom contains two major groups of animals, namely:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The invertebrate animals: these are the animals without backbone (vertebral 
        columns) </li>
    <li>The vertebrate animals: these are the animal with back bones (vertebrate 
        columns). /&quot; </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS</strong>
    <br />
    Invertebrate includes the:<br />
    (a) Phylum Porifera .
    <br />
    (b) Phylum Cnidarians (Coelentrales)
    <br />
    (c) Phylum Platyhelminthes
    <br />
    (d) Phylum Nematoda
    <br />
    (e) Phylum Annelida
    <br />
    (f) Phylum Arthropoda
    <br />
    (g) Phylum Echinodermata.</p>
<p>
    (A) PHYLUM PORIFERA These are the sponges. Members are simple primitive 
    multicellular animals. They are mostly marine, usually fixed to rocks, shells, 
    corals or other solid surface in the water: Some are radially symmetrical while 
    many other are irregular. Their body cells are less specialized and hardly form 
    tissues. The body encloses a cavity (enteron). The cavity is lined with peculiar 
    cells called <u>choanacytes.</u> Example of porifera includes leucosolenia, 
    (scypha, cliona).
</p>
<p>
    (B) PHYLUM CNIDARIAN (COELENTRATES)
    <br />
    Members are simple multicellular invertebrate animals, mainly Marine.
    <br />
    <strong>Characteristics of cnidarians </strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>They are radially symmetrical.</li>
    <li>They are diploblastic animals i.e. body wall composed of two layers of cells, an 
        outer ectoderm and an inner endoderm; these layers are separated by a 
        structure-less, gelatinous layer of mesogloea which may contain cells that have 
        migrated from other layers. </li>
    <li>They possess a gut with a single opening, the mouth, which is fringing by 
        tentacles. Each tentacles bears stinging cells called <u>cnidoblasts</u> which 
        can paralyses prey. Two different structural types are found in the 
        coelenterates: <u>polyps</u> and <u>medusa</u>. </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Polyps are sessile (stay in one place) and may be solitary e.g. hydra, or 
    colonial e.g. Obelia. Medusa are free-swimming and solitary they exhibit 
    polymorphism. Cnidarians are divided into three classes namely:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Class hydrozoa e.g. hydra</li>
    <li>Class scyphozoa e.g. Jelly fish</li>
    <li>Class Anthozoa e.g. sea anemones, corals. </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>PHYLUM PLATYHELMINTHES </strong>

    <br />
    CHARACTERISTICS
</p>
<ol>

        ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. </li>
    <li>They are un-segmented, like nematode worms, unlike annelids </li>
    <li>They have no coelom (body cavity )i.e. they are acoelomates animals, hence their 
        bodies are flattened </li>
    <li>Excretions are by flame cells. </li>
    <li>They are hermaphrodites </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Phylum platyhelminthes are divided into three classes:</p>

        individual. Majority do not possess suckers. Outer surface covered with cilia 
        for locomotion; cuticle absent. Enteron present, They have sense organs in adult 
        e.g. planarian l</li>
    <li>Class Trematoda (Flukes):</li>
    <li>They are either endoparasitic (live inside host) or ectoparasitic (live outside 
        the host) </li>
    <li>They have Ieaf-like shape</li>
    <li>Enteron is present </li>
    <li>They have sense organs only in the free- living larval stages </li>

    pair of legs. They exhibit metamorphosis which could be complete or incomplete.<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    (3) Class chilopoda (centipedes); they are mainly terrestrial. Member dwells in 
    moist environment. The body is divided into numerous similar segments which give 
    a worm-like appearance. No larval form gaseous exchange is by tracheae. They 
    have poisonous claws. They are mainly carnivorous
</p>
<p>
    (4) Class diplopoda (millipedes): they are terrestrial. Defined head with a pair

    through the tracheae. They are herbivorous e.g. millipedes.
</p>
<p>
    (5)Class Arachinida: these include the spiders, scorpions, mites and ticks. They 
    have two body division- the <u>cephalo thorax</u> and <u>abdomen.</u> The lack 
    antennae, compound eyes and wings. The cephalo thorax carries four pairs of 
    legs. No larval stage. Gaseous exchange is by &#39;lung&#39; books or &#39;gill&#39; books or 
    tracheae
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>(F)PHYLUM MOLLUSCA:</u></strong> These are animals with soft bodies.

    The class mammalian consists of three main sub-classes namely:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prototheria: </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are the primitive mammals. They bear many of the features of reptiles. 
    Such feature includes:
    <br />
    1. The possession of a cloacae and laying of eggs.
    <br />
    Example are the.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Duck billed platypus </li>
    <li>The spiny anteater.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are the two surviving of the species.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Metatheria:</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are the pouched mammals, sometimes referred to as the <u>Marsupials.</u>
    <br />
    They gave birth to their young ones alive but very much undeveloped. The young 
    is carried in a pouch where it is fed with milk from the mammary glands. Example 
    includes the kangaroos and koalas.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Eutheria </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are the placental mammals. Their young ones develop in a special bag- the 
    uterus within the body of the female. During development, the young one derives 
    its nourishment through the placenta. The sub-class is divided into the 
    following orders:<br />
    (1) Order insectivora e.g. hedgehogs, moles, Shrews<br />
    (2) Order dermoptera e.g. flying lemurs
    <br />
    (3) Order chiroptera e.g. bats, vampires
    <br />
    (4) Order primates e.g. monkeys, lemurs, ape, man</p>
<p>
    (5) Order endedata e.g. sloths, anteaters, panolin.
    <br />
    Order rodentia e.g. rats, squirrels, beaver, porcupine
    <br />
    Order lapomorpha e.g. rabbits, hare.
    <br />
    Order cetacea e.g. whales, dolphins.
    <br />
    Order carnivora e.g. cats dogs, bears, sea lions.
    <br />
    Order tubulidentata e.g. gardwark.<br />
    Order proboscidea e.g. elephant
    <br />
    Order hyracoidea e.g. hyrax
    <br />
    Order sirenia e.g. sea cows
    <br />
    Order perissodactyla e.g. horse, zebras, rhinoceroses
</p>
Order artiodactyla e.g. pigs, hippopotamus, camels, giraffe, okapi
