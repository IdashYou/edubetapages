  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mendel is best known for his studies of the pea plant.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mendel&#39;s first law (law of segregation)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">It states that a pair of genes (factor) is separated or segregated during gamete formation (spores in lower plants) and only one gene of a pair can be represented in a single gamete.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mendel&#39;s second law (law of independent assortment)</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">It states that when two or more pairs of genes of contrasting characters are present, each pair is independently inherited.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The F1 generation refers to the first filial generation. Filial generations are the nomenclature given to subsequent sets of offspring from controlled or observed reproduction.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The F2 (second filial) generation consists of the offspring from allowing the F1 individuals to interbreed.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The initial generation is given the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; for parental generation</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The theory of blending inheritance states that the progeny inherits any characteristic as the average of the parents&#39; values of that characteristic.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mendelian Genetics could not explain multiple alleles, incomplete dominance, sex-linked characters, co-dominance, linkage, sex determination, polygenic inheritance. Though his theory is the most acceptable but it needed these amendments. Mendel is the father of Genetics.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Genes, DNA and Chromosomes</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA bases. Some genes act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. However, many genes do not code for proteins. A DNA consist of many genes that code for different proteins.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Chromosomes are thread-like structures in which DNA is tightly packaged within the nucleus. DNA is coiled around proteins called histones, which provide the structural support.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A chromosome is made of a very long strand of DNA and contains many genes (hundreds to thousands). The genes on each chromosome are arranged in a sequence, and each gene has a location on the chromosome (called its locus).</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) are transcriptionally active chromosomes found in the germinal vesicle (GV) of large oocytes of many vertebrate and invertebrate animals and also in the giant single-celled alga Acetabularia. Their name stems from their similarity to bottle brushes. Lampbrush chromosome of the early prophase is a bivalent, made up of two conjugating homologues.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Adenosine 5&#39;-triphosphate, or ATP, is the principal molecule for storing and transferring energy in cells. Animals store the energy obtained from the breakdown of food as ATP. Likewise, plants capture and store the energy they derive from light during photosynthesis in ATP molecules.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">ADP needs to be converted to ATP for the body use.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Viruses are the smallest known organisms made of two parts; an outer part is protein and the inner part which is composed of genetic material DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid). It behaves as both living and non-living organism under different conditions. Once a virus finds itself in a host it replicates within the host by the help of its genetic material. It cannot reproduce outside the host.</span></p>
