          from Nigeria who nevertheless falls for the propaganda that London
          offers opportunities for self-expression and independence that will
          forever be denied her at home. When she finally makes it to England,
          however, she discovers its ugly racist and xenophobic character and
          quickly comes to see she is a second-class citizen. Yet she is not
          willing to embrace this reality, and continues to work hard to support
          herself and her children, as well as instill the children with pride
          and give them future opportunities. She pursues librarianship and
          writes a book, wrests the children away from their monstrous father,
          and continues her education and language studies, all the while
          navigating complicated welfare, health, and political systems.</span

          dissolute, spoiled, and privy to the worst patriarchal ideas. He
          becomes a Jehovah&apos;s Witness and thinks this means he does not
          have to do much to contribute to this life; he fails at being an

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >The novel begins with Adah as a young girl during the 1950s in
          Nigeria. Adah is bright, and from a very young age she knows she wants
          an education. She also dreams of moving to the United Kingdom one day.
          Despite it being less prevalent in her family for a girl to be
          educated, Adah secretly goes to school. Her parents beat her but let
          her attend anyway. After Adah&rsquo;s father dies, she is sent to live
          with her uncle&rsquo;s family. She secretly enrolls into high school,
          and despite being beaten for it again, she receives a scholarship due
          to her high score on the entrance exam.</span

          chooses to do so once she realizes she has to have a husband and a
          house in order to pursue her studies. She marries a man named Francis,
          who seems quiet and kind, and finds a job as a librarian. The couple

          convinces her in-laws to let her follow him. In London, Adah discovers
          that things are not as she expected them. Francis found a place to
          live in a poor neighborhood, surrounded by other Nigerian immigrants,
          and tells her that they can&rsquo;t expect better because they are
          second-class citizens. The welfare system is complicated and the

          pregnant again and she is alone during her birth. She decides to
          secretly take contraception, but Francis discovers and beats her for
          it. Adah gets pregnant yet again, and her husband gets progressively
          more abusive. She tries to fight back, telling him to find a job, and
