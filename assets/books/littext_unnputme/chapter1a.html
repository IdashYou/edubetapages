  <p><strong><u>Chapter By Chapter Summary</u></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p>
  <p>They were waiting for daddy who was a banker. Their mother (ummi) was outside. Her first child and only son Omar (18yrs old) was not at home. The laughter of 3 of her children; Teemah, Jamila and Bint, &nbsp;got her attention and she listened to their discussion. Bint (5yrs old) the last child, was telling her 2 sisters the story of her classroom encounter with their social studies teacher Mallam Salihu.</p>
  <p>According to Bint&rsquo;s story, her teacher asked the class to say good morning in French. No one could answer except Bint who answered and said &lsquo;Bonjour&rsquo;. She then asked the teacher how to say very good in french. The teacher who could not answer, went out to call the French teacher who answered the question by saying C&rsquo;est tres bien means very good in French. The pupils surrounded Bint &nbsp;and cheered her for asking a question the teacher could not answer.</p>
  <p>Their mum then entered the room to join the conversation. She usually joins them in their room unannounced to ensure they maintain personal hygiene and also to keep them company. Their mum said she was proud of Bint and also stated that it was a good of Mallam Salihu to call the French teacher than to give the wrong answer.</p>
  <p>While they were still talking, Omar came in to announce that he has been given admission to study law at the Kongo Campus of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. Everyone was happy about the news, especially their mother because it was Omar&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s dream to study law but it didn&rsquo;t work out due to finances.</p>
  <p>Omar was naive and really excited about his admission. His mother observed this and said to him that this admission is a life changer for him. That was where the title of the novel was gotten from.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p>
  <p>Ummi narrates her own story to her children of how her university admission was a life changer. According to her story, she got married to her husband before going for her university registration. The first thing she observed in the university was the care free attitude of people, she also found it difficult to identify student from lecturers. This was because unlike in secondary schools, the students in the university don&rsquo;t put on uniforms except from those in law who puts on white and black. She also said some girls dress almost naked.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;She told her children about her experience with Salma Mohamad, a fair complexioned girl, tall, slim and rather busty. Ummi met Salma at the faculty registration office where the new students waited for their registration. Accrding to Salma, if you are a boy the lecturers would ask you for money, while if you are a girl they would ask you for a date.</p>
  <p>Ummi then narrated her experience with the HOD in the departmental office when she went to get her matric number. She felt the HOD Dr. Samuel Johnson wanted to ask her on a date because he offered her a drink and told her she was beautiful.</p>
  <p>By the end of the day, Ummi went to her husband&rsquo;s house and told him all her experience. She was shocked when she found out Dr. Samuel Johnson was her husband&rsquo;s friend and he assisted in giving her admission into the university.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p>
  <p>Ummi &nbsp;&nbsp;narrated the story of Talle the quiet one to her children. In her story, Ummi reminded her children that in their little town Lafayette, almost everyone knew everyone else and they have a tradition of not accommodating strangers without the approval of the District Head, The Hakimi.</p>
  <p>Ummi went ahead to tell the story about Talle&rsquo;s birth. Talle&rsquo;s parents consulted the services of a formidable boka, a traditional medicine man due to their inability to bear children, and that was how Talle was born. Talle&rsquo;s mother died shortly after his birth, his father married another woman and they both raised Talle together. Talle was called the quiet one because he withdrew himself from people, and his quiet nature increased when his father and step mother died in an accident.</p>
  <p>Talle was a driver at the local government office. The sudden increase in his grocery requirement stirred suspicions from people and he was summoned by the Hakimi for questioning. While the questioning was going on, 3 police vans entered the Hakimi&rsquo;s compound. The truth was then revealed by the police men of how Talle and his friend Zaki kidnapped the 13year old son of a businessman for one week because Talle was in need of money. Talle and Zaki were arrested and imprisoned for kidnapping, armed robbery and extortion. The lesson was meant to teach Ummi&rsquo;s children especially Omar, not to judge a book by its cover. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p>
  <p>Ummi narrates Salma&rsquo;s experience in Dr. Dabo&rsquo;s office. Dr. Dabo was a highly disciplined lecturer, he was never heard to engage in any form of immorality with any student especially female students. He was the level coordinator and a no-nonsense lecturer who never allowed students into his class once he was there before them.</p>
  <p>However on the day Salma walked into Dr. Dabo&rsquo;s office to sign her forms, he got carried away by her dressing and beauty and he ended up asking her if he could know her more intimately and become friends. Salma said no, insulted him angrily and left his office. Dr. Dabo felt bad because the insults were deep and painful. He prayed to God to help him to be more dedicated.</p>
  <p>Salma then went for her hostel accommodation registration. Her hostel was Queen Amina hall. Salma didn&rsquo;t like her hostel at first because of her roommates. They were 4 girls in the room; Salma from the North, Tomiwa from the West, Ibadan in Oyo State, Ngozi from Umunze in Imo State and Ada from Benue or Middle Belt. Salma and Tomiwa were muslims, Ada and Ngozi were Christians. Salma and her 3 roommates later got along despite their different culture and religious belief. Food was the common factor that strengthened the bond of their friendship, as they enjoyed the delicacies of their different tribes.</p>
  <p>Salma was coming back home one evening when she met 2 men; Laraban and Habib who offered to take her to her hostel in their black Mercedes Benz car.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
  <p>In the evening when Laraban and Habib dropped Salma at her hostel, she gave them Tomiwa's phone number instead of hers. Tomiwa was a slim, busty and attractive girl but no boy asked her out because of her over confidence. &nbsp;By 8pm the next day,Tomiwa's phone rang. It &nbsp;was Habib, he was outside her hostel and he asked if they could meet up. Tomiwa was hesitant at first, she was scared if Habib and Laraban were kidnappers or cultists.</p>
  <p>Salma encouraged Tomiwa's and she went out to meet with the men. Habib then discovered that Tomiwa wasn't the girl they picked up the previous night, then she told him the truth. Habib offered to take Tomiwa to frizzlers, a restaurant in their school. Tomiwa found out that Habib was a politician and laraban was his driver and childhood best friend. Tomiwa told Habib that she didn't like politicians because they were &nbsp;like a spindle, nobody knew the direction they faced and they lied a lot. Habib told Tomiwa that he liked her. He gave her fifty thousand Naira and asked her to give ten thousand Naira each to her roommates and keep twenty thousand Naira for herself.</p>
  <p>He also bought suya, roasted chicken, a lot of provisions and beverages for Tomiwa and her roommates. Tomiwa got to the room and showed her roommates everything Habib bought for them including the money. Salma got jealous and wished she was the one who went out instead of Tomiwa. This led to an argument between Salma.and her 3 roommates as she accused Tomiwa for making Habib her boyfriend just so soon. The argument ended by a knock on their room door which they ignored and they settled down to eat the suya and roasted chicken.</p>
  <p>Salma later resolved to go out with Laraban. The four girls remained roommates from their first year to final year. Although they were studying different courses, they all did well academically and were certain to graduate with a second class upper degree.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Six </strong></p>
  <p>Teemah loves stories so much, she was hardly moving or breathing. Ummi continued with her story. Salma's last paper was moral philosophy, it was a general studies course and was considered to be very easy because its content included things taught by our parents, pastors or Imams.</p>
  <p>Salma found moral philosophy very difficult. She never attended classes because she believed she could pass without going to class. On the day of the exam, Salma dressed more stunning and beautiful because of her course mate pictures with their lecturer after the exam. Salma got her question paper and was surprised to find strange questions from.what she had prepared for and she could not answer any of them. She was the only one not writing in the exam hall. The female invigilator Dr. Amima noticed that Salma was not writing. She was intimidated by Salma's flashy appearance and she disliked her. Sitting next to Salma was Kolawole Abdul, he was the best in the class. Salma used the student magic trick (talking to the next person without moving your lips) on Kola and he gave her some answers on a paper.The invigilator caught Salma and she was askedto fill the EMAIL(Examination malpractice) form. Kola and another female student signed the form as witnesses.</p>
  <p>After the exam, Dr. Amina took Salma, Kola.and the other witness to the HOD's office. The HOD said the matter was beyond him and they should prepare the documents for the Exams and Ethics Committee for further processing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
  <p>This chapter recounts how Salma confided her friend, Tomiwa, how she thinks talking to Labaran to talk to Honourable Habib could influence anyone that matters to help her overcome her predicament. Unfortunately for her, the only influential person he knows that could help is Professor Dabo.<br /><br />Salma felt so helpless to hear that the same Professor Dabo she insulted in her l00level when he requested to be his girlfriend the one that can help. She immediately and desperately pleaded that honourable Habib to give her some money to bribe the chairman of EMEC who she described could sell his mother's soul for money. Honourable Habib agreed to give her some money but request that she gives him something in return. She yielded right in his office. After she got the money from Habib,<br />She prepared to meet with the Chairman of the EMEC in a hotel and gave only one hundred thousand naira to one Dr Mohammed Kabir as the Chairman of EMEC. She later discovered at the panel that she had been swindled by Dr Kabir who is an impostor. He is not even a lecturer at the University let alone the chairman of the EMEC.</p>
  <p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong><strong><br /></strong>This chapter summarises how Dr Mohammad Kabir got the appellation of a Doctor. It was a nickname given to him from secondary school. He was employed at the university as an L.T; Laboratory Technician but his friendliness got him intimacy with also all the people that mattered at the University.<br /><br />After Salma cried to Labaran and narrated her ordeal of how she was bamboozled by an impostor.
