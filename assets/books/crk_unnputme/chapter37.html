<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] Then King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar sent to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar had set up.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnez&apos;zar had set up.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And the herald proclaimed aloud, &quot;You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar has set up;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar had set up.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Therefore at that time certain Chalde&apos;ans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] They said to King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, &quot;O king, live for ever!</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego. These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Nebuchadnez&apos;zar said to them, &quot;Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego answered the king, &quot;O Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Because the king&apos;s order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Then King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, &quot;Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?&quot; They answered the king, &quot;True, O king.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] He answered, &quot;But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace and said, &quot;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here!&quot; Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego came out from the fire.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king&apos;s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their mantles were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] Nebuchadnez&apos;zar said, &quot;Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at nought the king&apos;s command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego in the province of Babylon.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom; but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Then these men said, &quot;We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Then these presidents and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, &quot;O King Darius, live for ever!</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Now, O king, establish the interdict and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Therefore King Darius signed the document and interdict.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the interdict, &quot;O king! Did you not sign an interdict, that any man who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?&quot; The king answered, &quot;The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then they answered before the king, &quot;That Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or the interdict you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed, and set his mind to deliver Daniel; and he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Then these men came by agreement to the king, and said to the king, &quot;Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no interdict or ordinance which the king establishes can be changed.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, &quot;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Then the king went to his palace, and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] When he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish and said to Daniel, &quot;O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then Daniel said to the king, &quot;O king, live for ever!</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] My God sent his angel and shut the lions&apos; mouths, and they have not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And the king commanded, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions -- they, their children, and their wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: &quot;Peace be multiplied to you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring for ever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] He delivers and rescues, he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span></p>
