<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and ungird the loins of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed:</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] &quot;I will go before you and level the mountains, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut asunder the bars of iron,</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Thus says the LORD: &quot;The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabe&apos;ans, men of stature, shall come over to you and be yours, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you.

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): &quot;I am the LORD, and there is no other.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness; I did not say to the offspring of Jacob,</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] &quot;Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] By myself I have sworn, from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return: `To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] &quot;Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength; to him shall come and be ashamed, all who were incensed against him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall triumph and glory.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Prophet Isaiah likens the nature of God to an earthen vessel and the potter. The relationship is such that exists between a master, who has absolute control and the servant who is a subject to the master and has no power of its own. Isaiah therefore maintained that the clay as a subject cannot challenge its maker or the potter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">He said, &ldquo;Woe to him who strives with his Maker, an earthen vessel with the potter.&rdquo; He went further to insist that the clay does not question the one who fashions it and woes anyone who says to the father, &ldquo;What are you begetting? or to a woman, with what are you in travail?&rdquo; These are impossibilities and clear expression of the masters&rsquo; superiority over their subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">In verses 11 and 12, the sovereign nature of God is affirmed as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&ldquo;Will you question me about my children, or command me concerning the work of my hands? made the earth, and created man upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has wrought toward me.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] I, Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] I had a dream which made me afraid; as I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Therefore I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chalde&apos;ans, and the astrologers came in; and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] At last Daniel came in before me -- he who was named Belteshaz&apos;zar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods -- and I told him the dream, saying,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] &quot;O Belteshaz&apos;zar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is difficult for you, here is the dream which I saw; tell me its interpretation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the air dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] &quot;I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] He cried aloud and said thus, `Hew down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven; let his lot be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] let his mind be changed from a man&apos;s, and let a beast&apos;s mind be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] This dream I, King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, saw. And you, O Belteshaz&apos;zar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshaz&apos;zar, was dismayed for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, &quot;Belteshaz&apos;zar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.&quot; Belteshaz&apos;zar answered, &quot;My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] whose leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the air dwelt --</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, `Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven; and let his lot be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him&apos;;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your tranquillity.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] All this came upon King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] and the king said, &quot;Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] While the words were still in the king&apos;s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, &quot;O King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like an ox; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] Immediately the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnez&apos;zar. He was driven from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles&apos; feathers, and his nails were like birds&apos; claws.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing; and he does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, &quot;What doest thou?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] Now I, Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">In the book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar is king over one of the powerful empire that has ever existed, the Babylon Empire. He was arrogant, confident, and it appeared that he was in absolute control of everything within the Empire and that he was sovereign over his own life and kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">However, in the fourth Chapter of Daniel he had a dream. Which disturbed him greatly that he summoned his magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, the astrologers and sorcerers to interpret to him what the dream meant, but they could not help him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At last Daniel who was named Belteshazzar was called and asked to interpret the dream after the king had narrated the dream to him. Not being comfortable with the dream prophet Daniel was alarmed and said, &ldquo;My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth; whose leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all; under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the air dwelt - it&apos;s you, O king, who have grown and become strong&rdquo; (4: 20-22).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The interpretation of the dream suggested that the king has become power drunk and sees himself as a sovereign being. As a result, prophet Daniel pointed out that he will be driven away from the people and made to live with the wild animals, where he will be made to eat grass like an oxen until he acknowledges that the Most High is sovereign and rules over the kingdoms of men.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">He however advised the king to accept his counsel by leaving his sins and practicing righteousness through showing mercy to the oppressed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Fulfillment of the Dream and the King&rsquo;s Confession</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At the end of twelve months, while the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, he said, &ldquo;ls not this great Babylon, which I have built with my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">While the words were still in his mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, &ldquo;O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you, and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like an oxen; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will&rdquo; (Daniel 4: 31-32).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Immediately the king was driven from among men and he ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles&rsquo; feathers and his nails were like birds&rsquo; claws.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At last when the king regained his reasoning, he acknowledged the Sovereignty of God and his everlasting dominion. Having realized this, he blessed, praised and honoured God who lives for ever and whose kingdom endures from generation to generation. His confession (Daniel 4:28-37) is that of a man humbled before the source of absolute power and authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
