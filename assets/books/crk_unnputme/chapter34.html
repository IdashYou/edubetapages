<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Kings 16: 29-34</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hana&apos;ni against Ba&apos;asha, saying,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] &quot;Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jerobo&apos;am, and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] behold, I will utterly sweep away Ba&apos;asha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Any one belonging to Ba&apos;asha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the field the birds of the air shall eat.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Now the rest of the acts of Ba&apos;asha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And Ba&apos;asha slept with his fathers, and was buried at Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] Moreover the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hana&apos;ni against Ba&apos;asha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jerobo&apos;am, and also because he destroyed it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Ba&apos;asha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he killed all the house of Ba&apos;asha; he did not leave him a single male of his kinsmen or his friends.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Ba&apos;asha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Ba&apos;asha by Jehu the prophet,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] for all the sins of Ba&apos;asha and the sins of Elah his son which they sinned, and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gib&apos;bethon, which belonged to the Philistines,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] and the troops who were encamped heard it said, &quot;Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king&quot;; therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] So Omri went up from Gib&apos;bethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king&apos;s house, and burned the king&apos;s house over him with fire, and died,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jerobo&apos;am, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy which he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] He bought the hill of Sama&apos;ria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he fortified the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Sama&apos;ria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] For he walked in all the way of Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat, and in the sins which he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Sama&apos;ria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Sama&apos;ria twenty-two years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all that were before him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat, he took for wife Jez&apos;ebel the daughter of Ethba&apos;al king of the Sido&apos;nians, and went and served Ba&apos;al, and worshiped him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] He erected an altar for Ba&apos;al in the house of Ba&apos;al, which he built in Sama&apos;ria.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And Ahab made an Ashe&apos;rah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] In his days Hi&apos;el of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abi&apos;ram his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Kings 7</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now Eli&apos;jah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, &quot;As the LORD the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And the word of the LORD came to him,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] &quot;Depart from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is east of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] So he went and did according to the word of the LORD; he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Then the word of the LORD came to him,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] &quot;Arise, go to Zar&apos;ephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] So he arose and went to Zar&apos;ephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, &quot;Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, &quot;Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] And she said, &quot;As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a cruse; and now, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And Eli&apos;jah said to her, &quot;Fear not; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make for yourself and your son.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] For thus says the LORD the God of Israel, `The jar of meal shall not be spent, and the cruse of oil shall not fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And she went and did as Eli&apos;jah said; and she, and he, and her household ate for many days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD which he spoke by Eli&apos;jah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And she said to Eli&apos;jah, &quot;What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And he said to her, &quot;Give me your son.&quot; And he took him from her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he lodged, and laid him upon his own bed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And he cried to the LORD, &quot;O LORD my God, hast thou brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, &quot;O LORD my God, let this child&apos;s soul come into him again.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Eli&apos;jah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And Eli&apos;jah took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Eli&apos;jah said, &quot;See, your son lives.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And the woman said to Eli&apos;jah, &quot;Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">The End of the Drought</span></strong></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] After many days the word of the LORD came to Eli&apos;jah, in the third year, saying, &quot;Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] So Eli&apos;jah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Sama&apos;ria.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And Ahab called Obadi&apos;ah, who was over the household. (Now Obadi&apos;ah revered the LORD greatly;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] and when Jiez&apos;ebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadi&apos;ah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And Ahab said to Obadi&apos;ah, &quot;Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadi&apos;ah went in another direction by himself.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And as Obadi&apos;ah was on the way, behold, Eli&apos;jah met him; and Obadi&apos;ah recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, &quot;Is it you, my lord Eli&apos;jah?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And he answered him, &quot;It is I. Go, tell your lord, `Behold, Eli&apos;jah is here.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And he said, &quot;Wherein have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord has not sent to seek you; and when they would say, `He is not here,&apos; he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And now you say, `Go, tell your lord, &quot;Behold, Eli&apos;jah is here.&quot;&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you whither I know not; and so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have revered the LORD from my youth.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jez&apos;ebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD&apos;S prophets by fifties in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] And now you say, `Go, tell your lord, &quot;Behold, Eli&apos;jah is here&quot;&apos;; and he will kill me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And Eli&apos;jah said, &quot;As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] So Obadi&apos;ah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Eli&apos;jah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] When Ahab saw Eli&apos;jah, Ahab said to him, &quot;Is it you, you troubler of Israel?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And he answered, &quot;I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father&apos;s house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and followed the Ba&apos;als.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Ba&apos;al and the four hundred prophets of Ashe&apos;rah, who eat at Jez&apos;ebel&apos;s table.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel, and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And Eli&apos;jah came near to all the people, and said, &quot;How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Ba&apos;al, then follow him.&quot; And the people did not answer him a word.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Then Eli&apos;jah said to the people, &quot;I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Ba&apos;al&apos;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Let two bulls be given to us; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; and I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, and put no fire to it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God who answers by fire, he is God.&quot; And all the people answered, &quot;It is well spoken.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then Eli&apos;jah said to the prophets of Ba&apos;al, &quot;Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Ba&apos;al from morning until noon, saying, &quot;O Ba&apos;al, answer us!&quot; But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped about the altar which they had made.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And at noon Eli&apos;jah mocked them, saying, &quot;Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice; no one answered, no one heeded.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Then Eli&apos;jah said to all the people, &quot;Come near to me&quot;; and all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Eli&apos;jah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, &quot;Israel shall be your name&quot;;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, &quot;Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] And he said, &quot;Do it a second time&quot;; and they did it a second time. And he said, &quot;Do it a third time&quot;; and they did it a third time.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And the water ran round about the altar, and filled the trench also with water.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Eli&apos;jah the prophet came near and said, &quot;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that thou, O LORD, art God, and that thou hast turned their hearts back.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, &quot;The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] And Eli&apos;jah said to them, &quot;Seize the prophets of Ba&apos;al; let not one of them escape.&quot; And they seized them; and Eli&apos;jah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] And Eli&apos;jah said to Ahab, &quot;Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Eli&apos;jah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] And he said to his servant, &quot;Go up now, look toward the sea.&quot; And he went up and looked, and said, &quot;There is nothing.&quot; And he said, &quot;Go again seven times.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] And at the seventh time he said, &quot;Behold, a little cloud like a man&apos;s hand is rising out of the sea.&quot; And he said, &quot;Go up, say to Ahab, `Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] And the hand of the LORD was on Eli&apos;jah; and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Elijah runs to Horeb for his life</span></strong></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Ahab told Jez&apos;ebel all that Eli&apos;jah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] Then Jez&apos;ebel sent a messenger to Eli&apos;jah, saying, &quot;So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Then he was afraid, and he arose and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] But he himself went a day&apos;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked that he might die, saying, &quot;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And he lay down and slept under a broom tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, &quot;Arise and eat.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And the angel of the LORD came again a second time, and touched him, and said, &quot;Arise and eat, else the journey will be too great for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And there he came to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, &quot;What are you doing here, Eli&apos;jah?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] He said, &quot;I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And he said, &quot;Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.&quot; And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And when Eli&apos;jah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, &quot;What are you doing here, Eli&apos;jah?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] He said, &quot;I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And the LORD said to him, &quot;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, you shall anoint Haz&apos;ael to be king over Syria;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel; and Eli&apos;sha the son of Shaphat of A&apos;bel-meho&apos;lah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And him who escapes from the sword of Haz&apos;ael shall Jehu slay; and him who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Eli&apos;sha slay.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Ba&apos;al, and every mouth that has not kissed him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] So he departed from there, and found Eli&apos;sha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Eli&apos;jah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And he left the oxen, and ran after Eli&apos;jah, and said, &quot;Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.&quot; And he said to him, &quot;Go back again; for what have I done to you?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Eli&apos;jah, and ministered to him.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</span></p>
