<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Luke 10: 32-42</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to come.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And he said to them, &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and salute no one on the road.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house!&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return to you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages; do not go from house to house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] heal the sick in it and say to them, `The kingdom of God has come near to you.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] `Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] &quot;Woe to you, Chora&apos;zin! woe to you, Beth-sa&apos;ida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] But it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And you, Caper&apos;na-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] &quot;He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] The seventy returned with joy, saying, &quot;Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And he said to them, &quot;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, &quot;I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yea, Father, for such was thy gracious will.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Then turning to the disciples he said privately, &quot;Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, &quot;Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] He said to him, &quot;What is written in the law? How do you read?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And he answered, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And he said to him, &quot;You have answered right; do this, and you will live.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Jesus replied, &quot;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, `Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] He said, &quot;The one who showed mercy on him.&quot; And Jesus said to him, &quot;Go and do likewise.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a woman named Martha received him into her house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&apos;s feet and listened to his teaching.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, &quot;Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] But the Lord answered her, &quot;Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">The Good Friendship between Jesus and Lazarus&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">John 11: 1- 44</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now a certain man was ill, Laz&apos;arus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Laz&apos;arus was ill.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] So the sisters sent to him, saying, &quot;Lord, he whom you love is ill.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] But when Jesus heard it he said, &quot;This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Laz&apos;arus.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] Then after this he said to the disciples, &quot;Let us go into Judea again.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] The disciples said to him, &quot;Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Jesus answered, &quot;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, &quot;Our friend Laz&apos;arus has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him out of sleep.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] The disciples said to him, &quot;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Then Jesus told them plainly, &quot;Laz&apos;arus is dead;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &quot;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Now when Jesus came, he found that Laz&apos;arus had already been in the tomb four days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Martha said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will rise again.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Martha said to him, &quot;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] She said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, &quot;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] and he said, &quot;Where have you laid him?&quot; They said to him, &quot;Lord, come and see.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] Jesus wept.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] So the Jews said, &quot;See how he loved him!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] But some of them said, &quot;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] Jesus said, &quot;Take away the stone.&quot; Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &quot;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] Jesus said to her, &quot;Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, &quot;Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] I knew that thou hearest me always, but I have said this on account of the people standing by, that they may believe that thou didst send me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, &quot;Laz&apos;arus, come out.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, &quot;Unbind him, and let him go.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, &quot;What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] But one of them, Ca&apos;iaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, &quot;You know nothing at all;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called E&apos;phraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, &quot;What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Friendship between David, Saul and Jonathan</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Sam.18: 1-3; 19</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father&apos;s house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his girdle.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul&apos;s servants.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] As they were coming home, when David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with timbrels, with songs of joy, and with instruments of music.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And the women sang to one another as they made merry, &quot;Saul has slain his thousands,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">and David his ten thousands.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; he said, &quot;They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And Saul eyed David from that day on.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, &quot;I will pin David to the wall.&quot; But David evaded him twice.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] And David had success in all his undertakings; for the LORD was with him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Then Saul said to David, &quot;Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will give her to you for a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the LORD&apos;S battles.&quot; For Saul thought, &quot;Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And David said to Saul, &quot;Who am I, and who are my kinsfolk, my father&apos;s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] But at the time when Merab, Saul&apos;s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to A&apos;driel the Meho&apos;lathite for a wife.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Now Saul&apos;s daughter Michal loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Saul thought, &quot;Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&quot; Therefore Saul said to David a second time, &quot;You shall now be my son-in-law.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And Saul commanded his servants, &quot;Speak to David in private and say, `Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you; now then become the king&apos;s son-in-law.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And Saul&apos;s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, &quot;Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king&apos;s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And the servants of Saul told him, &quot;Thus and so did David speak.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then Saul said, &quot;Thus shall you say to David, `The king desires no marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king&apos;s enemies.&apos;&quot; Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king&apos;s son-in-law. Before the time had expired,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king&apos;s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that all Israel loved him,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David&apos;s enemy continually.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.</span></p>
