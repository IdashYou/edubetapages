  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Christ before the High Priest (Math. 26: 36-75; Mark. 14: 53-75; Luke. 22: 66-71)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Math. 26: 36-75</span></strong><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem&apos;ane, and he said to his disciples, &quot;Sit here, while I go yonder and pray.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb&apos;edee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] Then he said to them, &quot;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, &quot;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, &quot;So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, &quot;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] Then he came to the disciples and said to them, &quot;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &quot;The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] And he came up to Jesus at once and said, &quot;Hail, Master!&quot; And he kissed him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] Jesus said to him, &quot;Friend, why are you here?&quot; Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, &quot;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&quot; Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Ca&apos;iaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[58] But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[59] Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[60] but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[61] and said, &quot;This fellow said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[62] And the high priest stood up and said, &quot;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[63] But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, &quot;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[64] Jesus said to him, &quot;You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[65] Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, &quot;He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[66] What is your judgment?&quot; They answered, &quot;He deserves death.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[67] Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[68] saying, &quot;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[69] Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, &quot;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[70] But he denied it before them all, saying, &quot;I do not know what you mean.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[71] And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, &quot;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[72] And again he denied it with an oath, &quot;I do not know the man.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[73] After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &quot;Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[74] Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &quot;I do not know the man.&quot; And immediately the cock crowed.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[75] And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, &quot;Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.&quot; And he went out and wept bitterly.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Mark&rsquo;s Account</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Mark. 14: 53-75</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[58] &quot;We heard him say, `I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[59] Yet not even so did their testimony agree.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[60] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, &quot;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[61] But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, &quot;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[62] And Jesus said, &quot;I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[63] And the high priest tore his garments, and said, &quot;Why do we still need witnesses?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[64] You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?&quot; And they all condemned him as deserving death.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[65] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, &quot;Prophesy!&quot; And the guards received him with blows.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[66] And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[67] and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, &quot;You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[68] But he denied it, saying, &quot;I neither know nor understand what you mean.&quot; And he went out into the gateway.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[69] And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders, &quot;This man is one of them.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[70] But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, &quot;Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[71] But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, &quot;I do not know this man of whom you speak.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[72] And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, &quot;Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.&quot; And he broke down and wept.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Luke&rsquo;s Account</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Luke. 22: 66-71</span></strong><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And he said to them, &quot;The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] &quot;You are those who have continued with me in my trials;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] &quot;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And he said to him, &quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] He said, &quot;I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And he said to them, &quot;When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?&quot; They said, &quot;Nothing.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] He said to them, &quot;But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, `And he was reckoned with transgressors&apos;; for what is written about me has its fulfilment.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] And they said, &quot;Look, Lord, here are two swords.&quot; And he said to them, &quot;It is enough.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] And when he came to the place he said to them, &quot;Pray that you may not enter into temptation.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] And he withdrew from them about a stone&apos;s throw, and knelt down and prayed,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] &quot;Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] and he said to them, &quot;Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] but Jesus said to him, &quot;Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, &quot;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] But Jesus said, &quot;No more of this!&quot; And he touched his ear and healed him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, &quot;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest&apos;s house. Peter followed at a distance;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, &quot;This man also was with him.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] But he denied it, saying, &quot;Woman, I do not know him.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[58] And a little later some one else saw him and said, &quot;You also are one of them.&quot; But Peter said, &quot;Man, I am not.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[59] And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, &quot;Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[60] But Peter said, &quot;Man, I do not know what you are saying.&quot; And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[61] And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, &quot;Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[62] And he went out and wept bitterly.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[63] Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[64] they also blindfolded him and asked him, &quot;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[65] And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[66] When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[67] &quot;If you are the Christ, tell us.&quot; But he said to them, &quot;If I tell you, you will not believe;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[68] and if I ask you, you will not answer.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[69] But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[70] And they all said, &quot;Are you the Son of God, then?&quot; And he said to them, &quot;You say that I am.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[71] And they said, &quot;What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Summary of the Trial</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, alter the celebration of the last supper There he said to them, &ldquo;Sit here, while I go yonder and pray&rdquo;. He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. He began to be sorrowful and troubled that he said to them. &ldquo;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Going a little further he fell on his face and prayed, &ldquo;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&rdquo; When he came to the disciples, he found them sleeping and asked them to watch with him for one hour and pray that they might not enter into temptation for the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">For the second time, he went out and prayed saying, &ldquo;Father, if this cannot pass unless drink it, thy will be done&rdquo; When he came back, he still found the disciples sleeping and their eyes were heavy with sleep. He left them for the third time praying in the same way.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">On coming back, he announced to them that the hour for the son of man to be betrayed into the. hands of sinners had come. While he was still speaking, Judas one of the twelve came in the company of a great crowd, carrying swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Judas who had earlier arranged with them to identify Jesus through a kiss walked up to Jesus saying, &ldquo;Hail, Master!&rdquo; He kissed him but Jesus said &ldquo;friend, why are you here?&rdquo; The crowd came forward and seized Jesus, prompting one of his disciples to draw his sword and cut the era of the slave of the high priest. Jesus however cautioned him to sheath his sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Luke noted that Jesus restored the ear and called on those who attempted to defend him especially his disciples to allow the scripture to be fulfilled.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At once the disciples fled except Peter who followed at a distance to the house of the high priest, where he sat inside with the guards to see the end. They sought false allegation against Jesus to kill him, but when they could not find any, they instigated two people who came up with false accusations that be claimed to be able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">When the high priest demanded for answer from Jesus, he declined and remained silent. The high priest pleaded with him to tell them if he was the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus responded that he had said so and added that he would see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">On hearing that, the high priest tore his robes claiming that Jesus had committed blasphemy and therefore requires no further Witnesses. The people responded in one voice that he deserves death. They spat on his face, struck him and some slapped him and asked him to prophesy to know who struck him.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At the point of his trial, Peter denied him three times before the cock crow just as Jesus earlier informed him. When the cock crowed at dawn, Peter remembered the words of Jesus. He then went out and wept bitterly.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, &quot;Are you the King of the Jews?&quot; Jesus said, &quot;You have said so.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then Pilate said to him, &quot;Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barab&apos;bas.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &quot;Whom do you want me to release for you, Barab&apos;bas or Jesus who is called Christ?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &quot;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barab&apos;bas and destroy Jesus.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] The governor again said to them, &quot;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&quot; And they said, &quot;Barab&apos;bas.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Pilate said to them, &quot;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&quot; They all said, &quot;Let him be crucified.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And he said, &quot;Why, what evil has he done?&quot; But they shouted all the more, &quot;Let him be crucified.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &quot;I am innocent of this man&apos;s blood; see to it yourselves.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And all the people answered, &quot;His blood be on us and on our children!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] Then he released for them Barab&apos;bas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand.

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And he answered them, &quot;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab&apos;bas instead.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] And Pilate again said to them, &quot;Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And they cried out again, &quot;Crucify him.&quot;</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab&apos;bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And they began to salute him, &quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre&apos;ne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And they brought him to the place called Gol&apos;gotha (which means the place of a skull).</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And the inscription of the charge against him read, &quot;The King of the Jews.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, &quot;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] save yourself, and come down from the cross!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, &quot;He saved others; he cannot save himself.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.&quot; Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, &quot;E&apos;lo-i, E&apos;lo-i, la&apos;ma sabach-tha&apos;ni?&quot; which means, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And some of the bystanders hearing it said, &quot;Behold, he is calling Eli&apos;jah.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, &quot;Wait, let us see whether Eli&apos;jah will come to take him down.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, &quot;Truly this man was the Son of God!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Mag&apos;dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salo&apos;me,</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] Joseph of Arimathe&apos;a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] Mary Mag&apos;dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] But Jesus turning to them said, &quot;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&quot;</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] And Jesus said, &quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.&quot; And they cast lots to divide his garments.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, &quot;He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar,</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, &quot;Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] But the other rebuked him, saying, &quot;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathe&apos;a. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Jesus was led out to be crucified after condemning him to death by the ruling authority. As they were going, they saw Simon of Cyrene and compelled him to carry his cross. When they came to Golgotha (the place of a skull), they offered him wine mixed with gall to drink, which he tasted and declined. Luke recorded that a great crowd including women were crying for him. But Jesus turned and said to them, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your children.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">After crucifying him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots. They put the charge against him, &ldquo;This is Jesus the king of the Jews.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">There were also two robbers who were crucified with him, one on the left and the other on the right. Luke observed that Jesus prayed for his enemies saying, &ldquo;Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">While Jesus was hanging on the cross, those who passed by derided him saying, &ldquo;You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the son of God, come down from the cross.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The chief priests, the scribes and the elders also mocked him saying, &ldquo;He saved others&rsquo; he cannot save himself. He is the king of Israel; let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.&rdquo; The robbers who were crucified with him also made mockery of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Luke pointed out that one of the robbers asked him whether he was the Christ, which prompted the other to challenge him asking him whether he had no regard for God. He pointed out that unlike them, that Jesus was unjustly condemned.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">He rather called on Jesus to remember him in His father&rsquo;s kingdom, which Jesus granted saying, &ldquo;Today, you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">At the sixth hour, there was darkness everywhere until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried in a loud voice, &ldquo;Eli, Eli lama sabachthani?&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;My God my God, why hast thou for sake me?&rdquo; some of those who stood by thought that he was calling Elijah, probably to come and save him. One of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed and then offered him to drink.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Jesus then cried in a loud voice and died. Immediately, the curtain in the temple torn into two, from top to bottom. This was followed by earthquake, splitting of rocks, opening of the graves and raising of the saints who had fallen asleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Luke noted that before he died, that he cried out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Father, into thy hands I. commit my spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw what happened, they were all filled with awe, and testified, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God.&rdquo; The devout women who witnessed his crucifixion were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the two sons of Zebedee. In the account of Mark, the third woman was Salome.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was granted and he took it and laid it in his own tomb, which he made in the rock.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">He covered the tomb with a great stone and left, while the women sat opposite the sepulchre.
