<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Jacob dwelt in the land of his father&apos;s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] This is the history of the family of Jacob.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&apos;s wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] He said to them, &quot;Hear this dream which I have dreamed:</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] His brothers said to him, &quot;Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?&quot; So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, &quot;Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, &quot;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Now his brothers went to pasture their father&apos;s flock near Shechem.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And Israel said to Joseph, &quot;Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&quot; And he said to him, &quot;Here I am.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] So he said to him, &quot;Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.&quot; So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, &quot;What are you seeking?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] &quot;I am seeking my brothers,&quot; he said, &quot;tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And the man said, &quot;They have gone away, for I heard them say, `Let us go to Dothan.&apos;&quot; So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] They said to one another, &quot;Here comes this dreamer.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, &quot;Let us not take his life.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And Reuben said to them, &quot;Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him&quot; -- that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ish&apos;maelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] Then Judah said to his brothers, &quot;What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Come, let us sell him to the Ish&apos;maelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.&quot; And his brothers heeded him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] Then Mid&apos;ianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ish&apos;maelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] and returned to his brothers, and said, &quot;The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Then they took Joseph&apos;s robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, &quot;This we have found; see now whether it is your son&apos;s robe or not.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And he recognized it, and said, &quot;It is my son&apos;s robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, &quot;No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.&quot; Thus his father wept for him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] Meanwhile the Mid&apos;ianites had sold him in Egypt to Pot&apos;i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Summary of the early life of Joseph and his arrival in Egypt</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Joseph was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and the second son of Racheal, one of the Wives of Jacob. At the young age of seventeen he took up the task of shepherding his father&rsquo;s flock with his brothers during which he brought an ill report of his brothers to their father.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Jacob (Israel) loved Joseph more than any other of his children because he was the child of his old age and also made for him a long robe with sleeves. These probably made his brothers conclude that their father loved him more than them and as a result they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">It happened that Joseph had a dream one day where they were binding sheaves in the field and behold his sheaf grew and stood upright to the extent that his brothers sheaves gathered round it and bowed down to his sheaf.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">His brothers were annoyed and said to him, &ldquo;Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?&rdquo; So, his brothers hated him the more for his dreams and for his words. Again, Joseph dreamt and told his brothers. In this one, the sun, the moon and eleven stars were bowing down for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">But after narrating this to his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, &ldquo;what is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves on the ground before you?&rdquo; His brothers were however jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">One day his brothers went to pasture their father&rsquo;s flock near Shechem and Joseph was not with them. So, Jacob sent Joseph from the valley of Hebron to see how his brothers were fairing at Shechem and bring him words. When Joseph got to Shechem a man saw him while he was wandering and asked him what he was seeking, Joseph replied that he was seeking his brothers and further asked the man whether he saw them. The man then directed him to go to Dothan. So, Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">When they saw him from afar, they conspired to kill him, saying to one another, &ldquo;Here comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wide beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will come of his dreams.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Reuben was however at hand to deliver him out of the hands of his cruel brothers saying, &ldquo;let us not take his life.&rdquo; He further said to them, &ldquo;Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him. He said this so that he will rescue him from them and restore him to his father.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">When Joseph came to his brothers, they removed his robe which was the robe with sleeves which their father made for him. They took him and cast him into an empty pit that has no water.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Then they sat to eat and on looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelite coming from Gilead with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh going down to Egypt. Judah one of Joseph&rsquo;s brothers said to them, &ldquo;What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelite&rsquo;s, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh. &quot;This advice was accepted by his brothers who drew Joseph up and lifted him from pit and then sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. The Ishmaelites took him down to Egypt where they later re-sold him to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, &quot;I remember my faults today.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &quot;The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] And the doubling of Pharaoh&apos;s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] And Pharaoh said to his servants, &quot;Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] So Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph&apos;s hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, &quot;Bow the knee!&quot; Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] And Pharaoh called Joseph&apos;s name Zaph&apos;enath-pane&apos;ah; and he gave him in marriage As&apos;enath, the daughter of Poti&apos;phera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom As&apos;enath, the daughter of Poti&apos;phera priest of On, bore to him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] Joseph called the name of the first-born Manas&apos;seh, &quot;For,&quot; he said, &quot;God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&apos;s house.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] The name of the second he called E&apos;phraim, &quot;For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &quot;Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Summary of Joseph as the governor of Egypt</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">After two years, while Joseph was in the prison, pharaoh had a dream in which he was standing by the Nile and there came out of the Nile seven cows sleek and fat feeding on the reed grass. And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the same Nile and stood by the other cows by the bank of the Nile. And the thin and the gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows and still remained thin that no one would know that they had eaten them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Again, Pharaoh had another dream where he saw seven ears of grain, plump and good, that were growing on one stalk. Then another seven ears of the same grain sprouted out which were thin and blighted by the east wind. The thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The dreams troubled Pharaoh that he summoned all the magicians from Egypt and all its wise men and told them the dream he had, but none of the could interpret be it to him. It was then his chief butler (servant) who told him how he met a young Hebrew in custody when he offended the Pharaoh, who was a servant of the captain of the guard and how the young Hebrew servant interpreted their dreams to them and it came to pass. Immediately pharaoh sent for Joseph and he was brought out of the dungeon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">After shaving and changing his clothes he was brought before the king and the king told him the dream which no one could interpret. Joseph said to him, &ldquo;It is not in me; God will give pharaoh a favourable answer.&rdquo; Having narrated the dreams to Joseph he said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.&rdquo; He explained that the seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. He further maintained that there will come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt, which will be followed by another seven years of famine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The famine will severe and consummate the land and the period of plenty will be forgotten in Egypt. He stressed that the doubling of the dream indicated that it was fixed by God and that God will shortly bring it to pass.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">On the remedy to avert the great famine Joseph advised Pharaoh to select a man who is discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt. He also advised him to appoint overseers over the land to take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years. And to gather all the food of these good years that are Coming and keep them in stock as reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The proposal was good to pharaoh and his servants that he said to them, &ldquo;Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?&rdquo; So pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are; you shall be over my house, all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne shall I be greater than you.&rdquo; Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt, gave him his signet ring and arrayed him in garment of fine clothes with gold chain about his neck. Joseph was also given the second chariot of the king which by implication made him the second in command after Pharaoh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&quot; As a mark of his new office, Pharaoh gave him the name, Zaphenath-paneah,&rdquo; and also gave him Asenath the daughter of Portiphera the priest of On in mage. Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">During the seven years of plenteous harvest, Joseph was up to his task by gathering food and storing them up in every city from the fields around them. He stored food in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Before the year of famine, Joseph had two sons namely Manaseh, which means &ldquo;God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; and Ephraim, meaning &ldquo;For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&rdquo; The seven years of plenty came to an end and the years of famine began just as Joseph said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">There was famine in all the lands except in Egypt. When the whole land of Egypt was famished, they cried to Pharaoh for bread who sent them to Joseph with the order, &ldquo;Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.&rdquo; So, when the famine spread all over the land, Joseph Opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians for the famine was severe and even people from all over the earth do go to Egypt for bread.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, &quot;Make every one go out from me.&quot; So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] So Joseph said to his brothers, &quot;Come near to me, I pray you.&quot; And they came near.

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Make haste and go up to my father and say to him, `Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The famine that broke out affected the earth greatly that Egypt became a pilgrimage centre of its sort.

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">In one of their trips when Joseph could not control himself again, he ordered all the people who were with him away and made himself known to his brothers who did not recognize him again and cried bitterly.&nbsp;</span></p>
