  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The nervous system has 3 main functions: sensory, integration, and motor. There are two major components of nervous system are:</span></p>
  <ol style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt;" type="1">
      <li style="margin-left:32pt; padding-left:4pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt;">The central Nervous system which consists of the brain and the spinal cord and function for integration and interpretation of impulses.</li>
      <li style="margin-left:32pt; margin-bottom:10pt; padding-left:4pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt;">The peripheral nervous system which consist of the afferent and efferent nerves and the sense organs.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The sensory function of the nervous system involves collecting information from sensory receptors that monitor the body&#39;s internal and external conditions. The Five Sense Organs in Human Beings. The sense organs &mdash; eyes, ears, tongue, skin, and nose &mdash; help to protect the body. The human sense organs contain receptors that relay information through sensory neurons to the appropriate places within the nervous system.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Neurons (also called neurons or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The location of communication between a nerve cell and another cell where impulses are passed without touching is called a chemical synapse. The tiny space between the two cells is called the synaptic cleft.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Synapse, also called neuronal junction, the site of transmission of electric nerve impulses between two nerve cells (neurons) or between a neuron and a gland or muscle cell (effector). A synaptic connection between a neuron and a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular junction.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Ganglia are ovoid structures containing cell bodies of neurons and glial cells supported by connective tissue. Ganglia function like relay stations - one nerve enters and another exits. The structure of ganglia is illustrated by the example of the spinal ganglion.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">An action potential (AP) is propagated when a neuron sends information down an axon, away from the cell body of the nerve cell. Action potential causes a change in polarity along the axon while its passing. During this process due to change in the permeability of the membrane, Sodium ion enters while potassium leaves through ion channels. Ion channels open only when the threshold potential is exceeded.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Neural Canal protects the spinal cord, it&rsquo;s absent in the Caudal vertebra. Moving down the vertebral column of a mammal towards the posterior end, transverse processes, articular surfaces, and, neural spines all become reduced in size and gradually disappear.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The cerebral cortex is required for voluntary activities, language, speech, and multiple brain functions, such as thinking and memory. In addition to the neuron bodies, the cortex also contains endings of neurons that reach it from other parts of the brain as well as a rich network of blood vessels.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The cerebellum is a small part of the brain positioned at the back of the head, where it meets the spine, which acts as the body&#39;s movement and balance control center. It also coordinates the timing and force of muscle movements initiated by other parts of the brain.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The cerebellum is primarily a movement control center, responsible for: Voluntary muscle movements. Fine motor skills. Maintaining balance, posture &amp; equilibrium.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The cerebellum plays a very important role in postural control and learning new postural tasks. The cerebellar control of posture is based on the closed connections of the cerebellum with vestibular system. It also helps in smooth and fine movement by modifying the motor neurons sent by the cerebral cortex.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><a name="_Hlk43337215"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The medulla oblongata also controls other involuntary actions including heartbeat, breathing. It is the part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord. Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that moves food to different processing stations in the digestive tract (Esophagus, stomach and intestines). The process of peristalsis begins in the esophagus when a bolus of food is swallowed. The part of the brain which controls peristalsis is the medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata also controls other involuntary actions including heartbeat, breathing.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Meninges are the membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord. There are three layers the dura mater (outermost layer closest to the skull), Arachnoid mater is the middle layer and the pia mater which is the inner layer that is adhered to the skull and spinal cord.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body&#39;s rest and digestion response when the body is relaxed, resting, or feeding. It basically undoes the work of sympathetic division after a stressful situation. The parasympathetic nervous system decreases respiration and heart rate and increases digestion, while sympathetic nervous system increases respiration and heart rate and decreases digestion.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The limbic system, also known as the paleomammalian cortex, is a set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, just under the cerebrum. It includes the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and several other nearby areas.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Reflex action:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Reflex action means sudden response or automatic reaction. Suddenly a needle pricks in the hand or on touching a hot object, we immediately turn off hand from the source of stimulation. This is the result of reflex action We cannot control the reflex action according to the will. Basically, it is controlled by the spinal cord, not by the brain.</span></p>
