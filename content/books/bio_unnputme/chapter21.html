    <strong>ECOLOGY</strong><br />
    <strong>Meaning of Ecology:</strong> Ecology is the study of plants and animals 
    in relation to their environment. Ecology is divided into two main branches:
    <br />
    (a) <u>Autecology:</u> Autecology is concerned with the study of an individual 
    organism or a single species of organism and its environment.
    <br />
    (b) <u>Synecology</u>: is concerned with the study of the inter-relationships 
    between groups of organisms or inter-relationships between groups of organisms 
    or species of organism living together in an area.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS </strong>
    <br />
    (1) ENVIRONMENT: The environment includes all the factors external and internal, 
    living and non-living factors which affect an organism.
    <br />
    (2) BIOSPHERE or ECOSPHERE: Is the zone of the earth occupied by living 
    organisms.
    <br />
    (3)LITHOSPHERE: is the solid portion of the earth. It is the outermost layer of 
    zone of the earth&#39;s crust.
    <br />
    (4) HYDROSPHERE: Is the liquid or aquatic part of the earth. It covers about 70% 
    or 2/3 of the earth crust.
    <br />
    (5) ATMOSPHERE: is the gaseous portion of the earth. It is layer of gas 
    surrounding the earth.
    <br />
    (6) HABITAT: is defined as an area occupied by a biotic community. The various 
    types of habitat are:<br />
    (a) Aquatic habitat: eg. Rivers, lakes, ponds, stream, lagoons, seas, oceans, 
    etc.<br />
    (b) Terrestrial habitats: e.g. savanna, forest. Desert, etc.
    <br />
    (c) Arboreal habitats: e.g. tree top, tree trunks
    <br />
    (7) BIOTIC COMMUNITY OR BIOME: A biotic community is any naturally occurring 
    group of different organisms living together and interacting in the same 
    environment. A biome is the largest community of organisms e.g. rain forest, 
    Guinea savanna, etc.
    <br />
    (8) ECOLOGICAL NICHE: Ecological niche refers to the specific portion of a 
    habitat which is occupied by a particular-species or organism.
    <br />
    (9) POPULATION: Population is defined as the total number of organisms of the 
    same species living together in a given area.
    <br />
    (10) COMMUNITY: Is a natural assemblage of several population of different 
    species of plants and animals living in a particular habitat.
    <br />
    (11) ECOSYSTEM: An ecosystem refers to a community of plants and animals 
    functioning together with their non-living environment. In order words, 
    ecosystem consist of the living factor (plants and animals) interacting with the 
    non-living factors, in an environment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Components of an Ecosystem</strong>
    <br />
    The ecosystem is made up of two main components. These are:
    <br />
    (a) Biotic components (b) Abiotic components
</p>
<p>
    (a) Biotic components: The biotic components include the living things (plants 
    and animals) which can be grouped into:
    <br />
    (i) Producer (ii) consumers (iii) decomposers
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(i) Producer</strong>: These are organisms which produce their own food 
    i.e. they are Autotrophs e.g. Green plants and some certain bacteria. The green 
    plants produce their food by using energy from sunlight, with the help of their 
    chlorophyll. They convert solar energy to chemical energy in food through a 
    process called <u>photosynthesis.</u></p>
<p>
    <strong>(ii) Consumers:</strong> They are the animals which feed on the 
    producer-green plants. They cannot make their foods. So they feed on plants.
    <br />
    (a) Primary Consumers: These are the heterotrophic animals which feed on the 
    producers directly. They are sometimes called Herbivores e.g. Grasshoppers, cow, 
    goat, sheep, etc.
    <br />
    (b) Secondary Consumers: These are the heterotrophic animals which feed on the 
    animals that feed on producers. Examples are dogs, cat, man, etc.
    <br />
    (c) Tertiary Consumer: There are the heterotrophic animals that feed upon 
    Secondary Consumers. Example include vulture, carnivores animals.
    <br />
    (d) Decomposers: These are organisms which feed on dead or decay plants and 
    animals e.g. certain bacteria and fungi.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Abiotic Components
    <br />
    An abiotic component is the non-living things which includes temperature, 
    sunlight, rainfall, CO2, O2, nitrogen, rocks, dust, storm, fire and water, etc.
    <br />
    <strong>Major Biomes of the World </strong>
    <br />
    These include:
    <br />
    (i) Tropical rainforest
    <br />
    (ii) Savanna
    <br />
    (iii) Desert
    <br />
    (iv) Shrub
    <br />
    (v) Afro-alphine&nbsp;
    <br />
    (vi) Swamp
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Population Studies</strong><br />
    Population is defined as the total number of organisms of the same Species 
    living together in a given area at a particular time. In an ecosystem the 
    community is made up of many populations of different species.<br />
    In population studies of a habitat, the following are usually studied: (1) Type 
    of organisms (2)dominance
    <br />
    (3) population characteristics: these include;
    <br />
    (a) Population size (b) population density (c) population growth rate
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Factors affecting population </strong>
    <br />
    (i) Natality (birth rate)
    <br />
    (ii) Mortality (death rate)&nbsp;
    <br />
    (iii) Immigration (dispersal)&nbsp;
    <br />
    (iv) Emmigration
    <br />
    (v) Availability of food
    <br />
    (vi) Breeding periods
    <br />
    (vii) Natural disasters e.g. fire, drought, floods etc.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Ecological Factors </strong>
  <br />
  Ecological factors are those factors in the environment which can influence 
  living organisms or cause changes in any habitat, be it aquatic or terrestrial 
  habitat. Ecological factors are grouped into two categories; Biotic factors and 
  Abiotic factors.<br />
  (a) <strong>Biotic Factors:</strong> Example of biotic factors are:
  <br />
  (i) Competition
  <br />
  (ii) Parasitism
  <br />
  (iii) Commensalism
  <br />
  (iv) Predation
  <br />
  (v) Pathogens
  <br />
  (vi) mortality
  <br />
  (vii) Migration
  <br />
  (viii) Dispersal
  <br />
  (ix) natality
  <br />
  (x) Food
  <br />
  (xi) diseases
  <br />
  xii) pests
  <br />
  <strong>(b) Abiotic Factor: </strong>
  <br />
  These include: (i) temperature (ii) rainfall (iii) light (iv) wind (v) pressure 
  (vi) hydrogen ion concentration (pH).
  <br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </strong>
  <br />
  <strong>Ecological factors common to Aquatic habitats </strong>
  <br />
  They include: temperature, rainfall, wind, light, pressure pH, salinity, 
  turbidity, dissolved gases, water current, density, tidal movement and waves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ecological factors common to terrestrial habitats </strong>
  <br />
  (i) tempggrature (ii) rainfall (iii) wind (iv) light (v) pressure (vi) pH (vii) 
  relative humidity (viii) edaphic or soil factors (ix) topographic or land 
  surface.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Simple Measurement of Ecological factors </strong>
  <br />
  Ecological factors that require measurements are rainfall, temperature, wind, 
  relative humidity, pressure, light, pH, turbidity, depth of water, slope, etc.</p>

  <strong>FUNCTIONS OF ECOSYSTEM</strong><br />
  It is made up of living organisms (plants and animals) and their non-living 
  environment.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Autotrophs: </strong>
  <br />
  Autotrophs are organisms (green plants and some bacteria) which can use, 
  sunlight or chemicals to manufacture their food from inorganic substances during 
  the process of photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Heterotrophs: </strong>
  <br />
  Heterotrophs are organisms, mainly animals, which cannot manufacture their own 
  food but depend directly or indirectly in plants for their food, hence they are 
  called consumers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Decomposers</strong><br />
  Decomposers are organisms that feed on dead organisms and other decaying organic 
  materials. Examples of decomposers are insects such as termite, larvae of 
  housefly, bacteria and fungi.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>FOOD CHAIN, FOOD WEB AND TROPHIC LEVEL </strong>
  <br />
  <strong>Food Chain: </strong>
  <br />
  Food chain is defined as a feeding relationship involving the transfer of energy 
  through food from producers to consumers.<br />
  Examples of food chain in terrestrial habitat are:
</p>
<p>
  Guinea grass ——&gt; Grasshopper----&gt; Toad——&gt; Snake ——&gt; Hawk——&gt;
  <br />
  (producer)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Primary Consumer) 
  (Secondary Consumer) (Tertiary Consumer)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>FOOD WEB </strong>
  <br />
  Food web is defined as a complex feeding relationship among organisms in the 
  same environment with two or more inter-related food chains. Food web contains 
  two or more food chains and therefore more organisms than food chain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>TROPHIC LEVEL </strong>
  <br />
  Tropic level is the number of links to which food energy is transferred from 
  producers to final consumers. For example, in a food chain like the one below.
</p>
<p>
  Guinea grass ------à Grasshopper------à Toad---------à Lizard—-àHawk-------à
  <br />
  (1st Trophic Level) (2nd Trophic level) (3rd Trophic level) (4th and 5th Trophic 
  level)
</p>
<p>
  There are five trophic or feeding levels.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>VARIATIONS IN POPULATION</strong><br />
  A population is defined as a group of organisms of the same species living in a 
  specified area within a given period of time.<br />
  <strong>VARIATION</strong><br />
  Variation is defined as the differences which exist between individuals of the 
  same species.<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPES 
  OF VARIATION</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Morphological variation</li>
  <li>Physiological variation</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
  Morphplogical variation:</u></strong> this refers to the noticeable physical 
  appearance of individuals of the same species. In human beings morphological 
  variations include;<br />
  (i) height of the body<br />
  (ii) shape of various parts of the body such as head, mouth, nose, jaw, eyes, 
  ears, legs and hands.
  <br />
  (iii) Finger print
  <br />
  (iv) Size of various parts of the body such as head, eyes, hands, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physiological 
  Variation: </strong>Physiological variation relates to the differences in the 
  ways individuals of the same species behave or react to conditions in their 
  environment.
  <br />
  Examples of physiological or discontinuous variation in human being are:
  <br />
  (i) Behaviour
  <br />
  (ii) Ability to close on eye and keep the other pen
  <br />
  (iii) Ability to move the ears without the head
  <br />
  (iv) Ability to taste a chemical substance called phenylthiocarbamide (PTC)
  <br />
  (v) Differences in blood group
  <br />
  (vi) finger prints.
  <br />
  Every human belong to one of these four groups of finger prints.
  <br />
  There are (i) Arch (ii) Loop (iii) Whorl (iv). Compound
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Examples of Discontinuous variation in plant </strong>
  <br />
  (i) Colour of leaves
  <br />
  (ii) colour flowers
  <br />
  (iii) colour of fruits
  <br />
  (iv) colour of seeds
  <br />
  (v) Shape of seeds are fruits.
  <br />
  <strong>Application of Variation </strong>
  <br />
  Variation has wide application in human life. These application include:<br />
  (i) crime detection (ii) blood transfusion (iii) determination of paternity (iv) 
  in medicine (v) in agriculture (vi) classification of human race.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ADAPTATION FOR SURVIVAL </strong>
  <br />
  Adaptation is defined as the possession of special features or structure which 
  improves the chances of an organism to survive in its environment.
  <br />
  <strong>Competition:</strong> Competition is defined as the process by which 
  living organisms in a habitat struggle or compete with one another for such 
  limited essential needs in the environment eg. light, nutrients, mates, shelter 
  and. space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Factors responsible for competition </strong>
  <br />
  The reasons for competition among plants include:
  <br />
  Inadequate (I) light (ii) space (iii) nutrients (iv) water
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reasons for competition among animals: Inadequate </strong>
  <br />
  (i) food (ii) space (iii) mates.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Types of Competition </strong>
  <br />
  There are two main types of competition. These are:
  <br />
  (i) Intra-specific competition: also called intra-species competition is the 
  type of competition between individuals of the same species.
  <br />
  (ii) Inter-specific competition: also called inter-specific competition, is the 
  type of competition which exist between individuals of different species. &#39;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Structural Adaptations </strong>
  <br />
  Structural Adaptation are special modification of structures which help 
  organisms to survive better in their various environment. Some examples of 
  structural adaptations are described below.</p>
<p>
  <strong><u>Structural Adaptation for obtaining food</u></strong><br />
  (a) By toad: (i) The toad possess special olfactory organ in the head for 
  perceiving the odour of its food.
  <br />
  (ii) The tongue is attached to the front of the mouth which can easily be 
  extended to capture or trap the prey.
  <br />
  (iii) The tongue is long and sticky to help hold the prey.
</p>
<p>
  (b) By Birds:
  <br />
  Birds have structural adaptation (beaks and feet) which enable them to obtain 
  food.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Structural adaptation for protection and defense </strong>
  <br />
  (1) Snakes: They attack their enemies or defend themselves by biting and 
  injecting their venom into the victim.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Adaptive Colouration</strong>:<br />
  Adaptive colouration is the possession by an organism of a colour which enables 
  it to catch its preys, avoid its predators or enemies and ensure their survival.
  <br />
  <strong>Example of Adaptive colouration in Animals</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Warning colouration: a warning colouration is one that scares away the animals&#39; 
      enemies or predators. For example, the black and yellow colour of variegated 
      grasshopper.</li>
  <li>Batesian mimicry: is a condition in which a harmless organism resembles a 
      distasteful or harmful one so that its enemies would avoid it.</li>
  <li>Camouflage: camouflage is a concealing colouration which matches the color of 
      the background. Example: grasshoppers have green pigments in their cuticle and 
      green snakes also have green pigments on their skin.</li>
  <li>Mating colouration: the conspicuous skin colouration in the adult males help the 
      adult females to select males of their own species for mating.</li>
</ol>
Counter shading: is the possession of two distinct colours (dorsal and ventral) 
by some organisms to match the colour of their environment.
