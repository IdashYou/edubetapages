  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">ADAPTATION</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Adaptation, in biology, the process by which a species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selection&rsquo;s acting upon heritable variation over several generations. Organisms are adapted to their environments in a great variety of ways: in their structure, physiology, and genetics, in their locomotion or dispersal, in their means of defense and attack, in their reproduction and development, and in other respects.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A halophyte is a salt-tolerant plant that grows in soil or waters of high salinity, coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, mangrove swamps, marshes and sloughs and seashores.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Hydrophytes are group of plants that have adapted to life in wet places or aquatic habitat. They have little to no root system because it is easier for them to obtain nutrients from water surfaces.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Bryophytes are a group of plant species that reproduce via spores rather than flowers or seeds.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Ferns reproduces through spores, not seeds, which are dispersed by a variety of methods, including water, gravity and animals, but the most common method of fern spore dispersal is wind.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Bryophytes grow in great masses and are very important in initiating soil formation on barren terrain, in maintaining soil moisture, and in recycling nutrients in forest vegetation.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Humans and Monkeys can move their thumb farther across their hand than any other primate. Having opposable thumbs helps in grasping things more easily, picking up small objects, and eating with one hand. An opposable thumb is a physical adaptation.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Air Spaces in bird&rsquo;s bones contained in the air sacs is an adaptation for flight, also only the vertebrae it the neck are flexible.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Amniotic egg is the type of egg produced by reptiles. Birds, and Protherian (egg laying mammals). It serves to provide nourishment throughout development. The embryo develops inside an amnion. The shell of the egg is either calcium based or leathery.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Clitellum is a thickened glandular and non-segmented section of the body wall near the head in earthworms and leaches, that secretes a viscid sac (cocoon) in which the eggs are deposited. The main function is therefore the protection of the eggs. It is located near the anterior end of the body.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Dispersal of seeds and fruits is the scattering of seeds and fruits away, from the parent plant to avoid overcrowding, thereby reducing competition for food (nutrients), space, water, and air. Agents of dispersal are wind, water, animals and explosive.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Both mimicry and camouflage are forms of defense for a species. Camouflage is when a species can change their colors or patterns to match its environment to blend in, like a chameleon! And&nbsp;</span><a name="_Hlk43276581"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">mimicry is when a harmless creature makes itself look dangerous, e.g. is moth having eye patterns on the wing.</span></a></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A caryopsis (plural caryopses) is a type of simple dry fruit that is monocarpellate (formed from a single carpel) and indehiscent (not opening at maturity) and resembles an achene, except that in a caryopsis the pericarp is fused with the thin seed coat. Examples are wheat, oats, barley, rice, and corn</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Cypsela is a dry single-seeded fruit that does not split open during seed dispersal and is formed from a double ovary in which only one ovule develops into a seed. It is similar to achene, and characteristic of members of the family Composite (Asteraceae), such as the dandelion and gray husks of a sunflower &quot;seed&quot;.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Achenes are monocarpellate and indehiscent. Achenes contain a single seed that nearly fills the pericarp, but does not adhere to it. Examples of achenes include buckwheat.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The difference between a cypsela and an achene is the fruit&#39;s origin. A cypsela is formed from an inferior ovary and may have a pappus, the modified calyx composed of awns, scales, bristles, or feather-like hairs, attached to one end. An achene is formed from a superior ovary and does not have a pappus attached.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A capsule is not a nut because it releases its seeds and it splits apart. Nuts, on the other hand, do not release seeds as they are a compound ovary containing both a single seed and the fruit.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. An example of mutualism involves goby fish and shrimp</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Commensalism: here relationship between two organisms in which one of the organisms is benefited while the other is neither benefited nor harmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The lichen is a symbiotic association composed of both fungal hyphae (which is a thread-like fungal cells) providing protection and structure and algal cells (photosynthetic). The fungal partner is usually an ascomycete and is dominant to the alga which is a green or blue-green alga.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within the nodules, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular host plant. Mycorrhiza form a network of filaments that associate with plant roots and draw nutrients from the soil that the root system would not be able to access otherwise. Root development is accelerated by the fungus enhancing root absorption of nutrient.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Rhizomes are found in some plants, and they are similar to stolons but grow horizontally at or below the soil surface and can be fleshy and thicker than stolons.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><a name="_Hlk43268029"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A bulb is modified plant organ that consists of a relatively large, usually globe shaped, underground bud with membranous or fleshy overlapping leaves arising from a short stem. A bulb&rsquo;s fleshy leaves -which in some species are expanded leaf bases function as food reserves that enable a plant to lie dormant when water is unavailable (during winter or drought) and resume its active growth when favorable conditions again prevail. An onion is a commonly known bulb.</span></a></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><a name="_Hlk43340288"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Parthenocarpy is the natural or artificially induced production of fruit without fertilization of ovules, which makes the fruit seedless. Stenospermocarpy may also produce apparently seedless fruit, but the seeds are aborted while they are still small. Stenospermocarpy can occur in mango as a result of cold temperature.</span></a></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><a name="_Hlk43340641"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Parthenogenesis (parthenos = virgin, genes = born) The development of an organism from an unfertilized egg.</span></a></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Pitcher plants are several different carnivorous plants which have modified leaves known as pitfall traps&mdash;a prey-trapping mechanism featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be &quot;true&quot; pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown their prey with nectar. Examples are Drosera, Dionaea muscipula, Nepenthes, Utricularia and sarracenia.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Cold-blooded animals are the animals which cannot regulate their internal body temperature according to the required level and they keep on changing their temperature according to the changes in external environment temperature. Although Warm-blooded animals attempt to keep their internal body temperature maintained and does not change the same along with changes in external environment.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Cold-blooded animals can be either terrestrial or aquatic. All reptiles, including snakes, lizards, turtles, tortoises, alligators, and crocodiles, some insects such as the busy dragonflies and bees, amphibians such as frogs, toads, and salamanders, as well as fish, including sharks, are all cold-blooded animals.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">With a few exceptions, all mammals and birds are warm-blooded, and all reptiles, insects, arachnids, amphibians and fish are cold-blooded.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Moulting (or molting) is the way an animal routinely casts off part of its body (usually the outer layer or covering) at a particular time of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle. Moulting can involve the epidermis (skin), and hair, fur, wool, or other external layer.</span></p>
