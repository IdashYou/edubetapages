  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">ENZYMES AND HORMONES</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Enzymes are biocatalyst, speed up chemical reactions because they lower down the energy of activation. They can do this because they form a complex with their substrate(s) at the active site.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Many enzymes have co-factors or co-enzymes that help them to carry out a reaction. Co-enzymes have non-protein organic molecules and are often derived, at least in part, from vitamins.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Repressible enzymes are usually the enzymes involved in biosynthetic or anabolic pathways, e.g. tryptophan synthetase produced by the E. coli when tryptophan (an important amino acid required for synthesizing proteins) is not available from the culture medium.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">An adaptive enzyme or inducible enzyme is an enzyme that is expressed only under conditions in which it is clearly of adaptive value, as opposed to a constitutive enzyme which is produced all the time. The Inducible enzyme is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Digestive enzymes are found in the digestive tracts of animals (including humans) and in the tracts of carnivorous plants, where they aid in the digestion of food, as well as inside cells, especially in their lysosomes, where they function to maintain cellular survival.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Chymosin, known also as rennin, is a proteolytic enzyme related to pepsin that synthesized by chief cells in the stomach of some animals. Its role in digestion is to curdle or coagulate milk in the stomach, a process of considerable importance in the very young animal.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Invertase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis (breakdown) of sucrose (table sugar) into fructose and glucose.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides (that is, a protease). Pepsin&#39;s proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas. They are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels, but in opposite fashion! Insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells (a type of islet cell) of the pancreas.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Fats are digested by lipases that hydrolyze the glycerol fatty acid bonds.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Various factors affect the yield of enzymatic reactions, such as the concentration of the substrate(s), the temperature and the pH. A high temperature or a pH outside the preferred range for that enzyme can lead to denaturation, a change in structure that prevents the enzyme from functioning.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Hormones</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A hormone is any chemical produced in one part of the body and carried to all or some parts by body (target organs) where it produces some physiological effect. There are five classes of hormones in plants: Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinin, Abscisic Acid and Ethylene. Auxins are generally recognized as the most important and it is being produced in the stem, buds, and root tips. They promote stem elongation and inhibit growth of lateral buds (maintains apical dominance). This is the reason why plant apex keeps growing faster than other parts.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Abscisic acid (ABA) is an inhibitory hormone in plants that helps a plant adapt to stress. It also plays a key role in the closure of the plant&#39;s stomata (leading to leaf fall), bud development, and seed dormancy.</span></p>
