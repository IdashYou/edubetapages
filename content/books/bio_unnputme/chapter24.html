  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Meiosis&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A kind of cell division during spermatogenesis (sperm formation) and oogenesis (egg formation) in which there is a reduction of chromosomes to half of the original number of chromosomes. During spermatogenesis or oogenesis in human, the 46 chromosomes are reduced to 23. Therefore, each sperm or egg now has 23 chromosomes. The fusion of the sperm and egg gives 46 chromosomes which every human being has.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The Purpose of Meiosis</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Meiosis creates genetic variation and makes haploid gamete cells. Before meiosis begins, all of the DNA in the cell is copied, so each chromosome contains two identical sister chromatids. Meiosis is divided into two divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each division can be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. After telophase, the cell divides into two daughter cells. Between the two cell divisions, DNA replication does not occur. Through this process, one diploid cell will divide into four haploid gamete cells.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Mitosis&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A process of cell division during which each chromosome in the nucleus duplicates itself and two new cells are fanned with equal number of chromosomes.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Cytokinin (Kinin) is a plant hormone (restricted only to the tissue where it is secreted) that stimulates mitosis (cell division) in plants. Cytoplasm The protoplasmic materials surrounding the nucleus and is itself surrounded by cell membrane.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Interphase: the period of growth of a cell that occurs between mitotic divisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Prophase is the first phase of mitosis, the process that separates the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells. During prophase, the complex of DNA and proteins contained in the nucleus, known as chromatin, condenses.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Metaphase is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage. These chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align at the equator of the cell before being separated into each of the two daughter cells.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Chromosomal crossover, or crossing over, is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes non-sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Haploid VS. Diploid</span></strong></p>
  <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid, referred to as 2n, where &lsquo;n&rsquo; is the number of sets of chromosomes. Most of the cells in a human body are diploid. These diploid cells are referred to as somatic cells. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid, referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, it is called fertilization, and a diploid zygote will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.</span></p>
