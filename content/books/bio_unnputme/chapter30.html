  <div class="question">A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic  material (DNA or RNA). Mutations are a rare but signi&#64257;cant biological process,  since they provide the variation on which evolution acts and are also the  source of cancer. </div><br />
  <div class="question">Gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly  derived from epithelium. Glands are classi&#64257;ed into endocrine and exocrine by  where they excrete. </div><br />
  <div class="question">Endocrine glands secrete hormones into the blood without use  of ducts.</div><br />
  <div class="question">&nbsp;Exocrine glands  secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine  substances include sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the  liver, which secretes bile.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;<br>
    chondoroblasts form cartilage;<br>
    osteoblasts form bone;<br>
    and blood is formed from various sources.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in  gall bladder, released in duodenum, emulsi&#64257;es fats.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in  elephant ears, takes more blood to surface of body, sweating may accompany.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red  and white blood cells, and platelets). Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume.  Cellular elements make up the other 45%.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions  in oxygen transport. In mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and  take on biconcave, dimpled, shape. No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x  more red blood cells than white blood cells. About 7-8 micrometers in diameter</div><br />
  <div class="question">Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by  cells, about 43% in humans on average. 48% for men and 38% for women</div><br />
  <div class="question">Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called  arterioles, feed blood to capillaries. <br>
    Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.</div><br />
  <div class="question">Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult  mammal,four chambers form two separate circulations<br>
    1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and<br>
    2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body. <br>
    Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed <br>
    Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more  powerful than right </div><br />
  <div class="question">Two types of photoreceptors<br>
    1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in  each retina in humans.<br>
    2. cones - color vision, work best under better  illumination. 3 million in each retina.</div><br />
