    <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">Subject Matter</span></strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">This poem brings to mind , &ldquo;the animal farm&rdquo; by George Orwell. It is a satire on the political struggles and calculations by the major linguistic groups in Nigeria, and by extension other countries in Africa. Is it either through a &rdquo; bloodless coup&rdquo; by rigging the election, with the vote buying or by military coup. This will enable the the political actors , to impose an incompetent ruler in the governance of the county.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <ol>
        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:11pt;">
            <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The main theme of this poem is the struggle for political power and relevance at the centre of government by the major linguistic groups in the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:11pt;">
            <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The theme of poor governance and poor followership.&nbsp;</span></p>
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:11pt;">
            <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The theme of corruption, a fallout of poor governance.</span></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">STRUCTURE&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The poem is made up of (12) twelve stanza of two lines each. Ina stanza 1(one) the lion States his manifesto and intends to contest for the leadership position of the animals pack. However, in stanza 2 (two) the antelopes fault &rdquo; the ferocious pounce of his paws.&rdquo; Which is not required of a leadership at that level.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Similarly, In stanza 3, the hyena express his wish to contest for the highest office in the group. Whereas, &ldquo;the impalas shudder&rdquo; and his lethal appetite is seem by the other animals. As a challenge to his candidacy, in stanza 4, the giraffe, another leadership candidate campaigns to be elected as the leader of the pack. He is disqualified on the promise that his eyes &ldquo;are too far from the ground.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">In stanza 5, the zebra joins the race for leadership position at the centre. The group &rdquo; points to the duplicity of his stripes&rdquo; as a major a factor for his disqualification. Furthermore, in stanza 6, the elephant, the biggest of the pack, sees his size as an added advantage to the claim of leader position of the group.&rdquo; But is colleagues dread his trampling feet &ldquo;. Accordingly, his is disqualified from the leadership race.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Also, the warthog and rhino in stanza 7, are also asked to withdraw from the leadership contest because of their ugliness and riotous nature respectively. In stanza 8, the political struggle between the members of the pack, for the leadership position at the centre. Makes the group to look &rdquo; like a snake without a head&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">In stanza 9, there, is a call for hybrid of habits by the sage in the Forrest, As a result, in stanza 10, they is a call for caution by some wise member of the pack. For a leader who is &rdquo; A little bit of lion&rdquo; and a &ldquo;little bit of lamp.&rdquo; Such a leader is viewed as having the capacity to lead the (members of the pack) and bring about positive development in the animal pack.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">In stanza 11, the qualities of a good leader is further highlighted. The wise ones, further state that the he should be &ldquo;tough like a tiger, compassionate like a doe.&rdquo; Besides, he must be transparent &rdquo; like a river, mysterious like a lake.&rdquo; In stanza 12, the pack demands and resolve to vote for &rdquo; A leader who knows how to how to follow &rdquo; and has the ability to make the&rdquo; followers mindful of their right to lead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">MOOD: the poet&rsquo;s mood is that of disappointment, following the poor governance of the country, that is rich in human and natural resources.</span></p>
