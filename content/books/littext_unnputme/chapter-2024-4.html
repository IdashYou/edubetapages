          >&nbsp;He is the central character of the story. Nii is a Nigerian by
          blood but a Ghanaian by birth. His complete name is Nii Moses Orojo
          but when he is left in the custody of a Ghanaian neighbour, after his
          family moves back to Nigeria, he is given a Ghanaian name. He is a
          young Accounting university graduate and the Assistant Manager with
          Expense Bank. He gets married to a young Ghanaian woman, Massa but
          they are faced with ill-luck in their marriage. The only thing that
          can identify Nii as a Nigerian is his Yoruba tribal marks and the
          Orojo family name. Nii later finds his way to Nigeria amidst turbulent
          situations. Like Joseph in the Bible, he refuses to succumb to the
          amorous tendencies of Linda. He is hardworking, as he does extra work
          to augment his income; though he is indebted to the bank despite his
          efforts. He is eventually reunited with his sister and they both reap
          unexpected joy at dawn.&nbsp;</span

          >&ldquo;Unexpected Joy at Dawn&rdquo; is a story of two siblings,
          NiiTackie and his sister, Mama Orojo. Several years before they are
          born, their great grandparents migrate from Nigeria to Ghana where
          they give birth to and raise their children. They literally regard
          Ghana as their home. However, in 1970/1971, when Ghana enacts the
          Aliens Compliance Order forcing all illegal immigrants (foreigners) to
          return to their country, this brings about loss of lives and property.
          It is in this Circumstance that Mama Orojo decides to go back to
          Nigeria. She leaves behind her brother, Nii with a granny in the care
          of a family friend because Nii is too young to embark on dangerous
          journey to Nigeria by road. Mama Is eighteen years as at the time.
          Nii&apos;s name is then changed from Orojo to Akrong Na bi to reflect
          the name of his adopted parents whom he stays with. Even though he
          graduates from the university where he studies Accounting and becomes
          the Assistant Manager of a bank, he is still living from hands to
          mouth coupled with the fear of being deported someday.&nbsp;</span

          >He marries a Ghanaian woman, Massa who dies of terminal disease at
          the age of twenty-two after a protracted illness. Nii is not even able
          to bury his wife due to his poor financial situation. Even as an
          Assistant Bank Manager at Expense Bank, he does part-time teaching job
          to earn extra income to supplement his salary. After fourteen years of
          living in hardship and fear in Ghana, he decides to go to Nigeria in
          search of his biological family members who are of Ijase origin in
          South-West Nigeria. But his greatest fear is how to prove that he is a
          Nigerian since he cannot speak any of the Nigerian languages. Although
          he has tribal marks and he bears a Yoruba name, yet, he does not look
          nor dress like a Nigerian. Moreover, the period coincides with the
          time when the Nigerian government orders all Ghanaians to leave
          Nigeria within two weeks. Nii&apos;s situation is terribly compounded
          due to these rising tensions in Ghana against Nigerians as a direct
          result of the predicament of Ghanaians in Nigeria. Thus, blackness and
          Yoruba name alone cannot grant Nii the citizenship and staying permit
          in Nigeria. He actually needs more than that.&nbsp;</span

          the CEO of Mama Sansi Group of Companies. She is the first person to

          town. Her construction company has constructed more than half of the
          houses in that town. However, at a time, she begins to have a
          nostalgic feeling to look for her brother whom she leaves in Ghana
          many years before. Therefore, she travels to Ghana in search of Nii.
          By a twist of fate, she meets and falls in love with a gold dealer,
          Joe, who is a former customer of Expense Bank, where Nii has worked as
          an Assistant Manager. It is in search of Nii, that they realize the
          enormity of the problem they have at hand including the burial of
          Nii&apos;s wife, Massa whom Nii has dumped in the hospital mortuary

          considered an alien in that country. The Government of Ghana passed a
          law asking all aliens without resident permit to regularize their stay
          in the country. You see, my great grandparents had migrated to Ghana
          several years before, and regarded Ghana their home, you see. |

          the opposition party then had hyped to monstrous heights that aliens
          were ruining the country; or the government of the day blamed their
          failure to do things right on us &lsquo;aliens&apos; scapegoats... It
          was difficult to start life all over again, and even more difficult to

          >Survival is extremely difficult for Nii in Nigeria. Therefore, he
          engages in many things just to survive. He once serves as a slave in
          someone&apos;s cassava farm and lives in slums before he moves to
          deportation camp and later, he becomes a building labourer. In the
          process of moving from one place to another without any specific
          direction, Nii and Aaron (his friend that they leave Ghana together)
          go to the upper floor of an uncompleted storey-building to rest for
          the night. Coincidentally, it is Mama&apos;s uncompleted residential
          house in Ijase. Eventually, the occupants of the house take them for
          armed robbers and make an attempt to arrest them. Aaron jumps down
          from the storey building and dies immediately. With this, Nii has lost
          a lover, Marshak, and a friend, Aaron, with whom they cross the border
          into Nigeria. Vigilantes arrest Nii in the presence of the residents
          of the house. Fortunately, Joe and his fianc&eacute;e, Mama are also
          residents of the same house. In the process, Nii recognizes Joe and
          his sister, the same sister he has come to Nigeria to look for. It is
          amazing for two lost siblings to see each other again after so many
          years of separation. It is quite a moment of unexpected joy at dawn
          for both of them.&nbsp;</span
