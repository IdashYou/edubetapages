          >Jimmy Porter is the play&apos;s main character. He is the &quot;Angry
          Young Man&quot; who expresses his frustration for the lack of feelings
          in his placid domestic life. Jimmy can be understood as both a hero
          for his unfiltered expressions of emotion and frustration in a culture
          that propagated unemotional resignation. He can also be considered a
          villain for the ways in which his anger proves to be destructive to
          those in his life.</span

          their attic apartment. He is a working class Welsh man and Jimmy makes
          sure to often point out that he is &quot;common&quot; and uneducated.
          Cliff believes this is the reason that Jimmy keeps him as a friend. He
          is quite fond of Alison and they have a strange physically
          affectionate relationship throughout the play.</span

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >Look Back in Anger begins in the attic flat apartment of Jimmy Porter
          and Alison Porter. The setting is mid-1950&apos;s small town England.
          Jimmy and Alison share their apartment with Cliff Lewis, a young
          working class man who is best friends with Jimmy. Cliff and Jimmy both
          come from a working class background, though Jimmy has had more
          education than Cliff. They are in business together running a
          sweet-stall. Alison comes from a more prominent family and it is clear
          from the beginning that Jimmy resents this fact.</span

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >The first act opens on a Sunday in April. Jimmy and Cliff are reading
          the Sunday papers while Alison is ironing in a corner of the room.
          Jimmy is a hot tempered young man and he begins to try and provoke
          both Cliff and Alison. He is antagonistic towards Cliff&apos;s working
          class background and makes fun of him for his low intelligence. Cliff
          is good natured and takes the antagonism. Jimmy attempts to provoke
          his wife, Alison, by making fun of her family and her well-heeled life
          before she married him. Jimmy also seems to display a nostalgia for
          England&apos;s powerful past. He notes that the world has entered a
          &quot;dreary&quot; American age, a fact he begrudgingly accepts.
          Alison tires of Jimmy&apos;s rants and begs for peace. This makes
          Jimmy more fevered in his insults. Cliff attempts to keep peace
          between the two and this leads to a playful scuffle between the two.
          Their wrestling ends up running into Alison, causing her to fall down.
          Jimmy is sorry for the incident, but Alison makes him leave the
          room.</span

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >After Jimmy leaves, Alison confides to Cliff that she is pregnant
          with Jimmy&apos;s child, though she has not yet told Jimmy. Cliff
          advises her to tell him, but when Cliff goes out and Jimmy re-enters
          the room, the two instead fall into an intimate game. Jimmy
          impersonates a stuffed bear and Alison impersonates a toy squirrel.
          Cliff returns to tell Alison that her old friend, Helena Charles, has
          called her on the phone. Alison leaves to take the call and returns
          with the news that Helena is coming to stay for a visit. Jimmy does
          not like Helena and goes into a rage in which he wishes that Alison
          would suffer in order to know what it means to be a real person. He
          curses her and wishes that she could have a child only to watch it
          die.</span

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >Two weeks later, Helena has arrived and Alison discusses her
          relationship with Jimmy. She tells of how they met and how, in their
          younger days, they used to crash parties with their friend Hugh
          Tanner. Jimmy maintains an affection for Hugh&apos;s mother, though
          his relationship with Hugh was strained when Hugh left to travel the
          world and Jimmy stayed to be with Alison. Jimmy seems to regret that
          he could not leave, but he is also angry at Hugh for abandoning his
          mother. Helena inquires about Alison&apos;s affectionate relationship
          with Cliff and Alison tells her that they are strictly friends.</span

          >Cliff and Jimmy return to the flat and Helena tells them that she and
          Alison are leaving for church. Jimmy goes into an anti-religious rant
          and ends up insulting Alison&apos;s family once again. Helena becomes
          angry and Jimmy dares her to slap him on the face, warning her that he
          will slap her back. He tells her of how he watched his father die as a
          young man. His father had been injured fighting in the Spanish Civil
          War and had returned to England only to die shortly after. Alison and
          Helena begin to leave for church and Jimmy feels betrayed by his
          wife.</span

          >A phone call comes in for Jimmy and he leaves the room. Helena tells
          Alison that she has called Alison&apos;s father to come get her and
          take her away from this abusive home. Alison relents and says that she
          will go when her father picks her up the next day. When Jimmy returns,
          he tells Alison that Mrs. Tanner, Hugh&apos;s mother, has become sick
          and is going to die. Jimmy decides to visit her and he demands that
          Alison make a choice of whether to go with Helena or with him. Alison
          picks up her things and leaves for church and Jimmy collapses on the
          bed, heartbroken by his wife&apos;s decision.</span

        <span style="font-size: 11pt"
          >The next evening Alison is packing and talking with her father,
          Colonel Redfern. The Colonel is a soft spoken man who realizes that he
          does not quite understand the love that exists between Jimmy and
          Alison. He admits that the actions of him and his wife are partly to
          blame for their split. The Colonel was an officer in the British
          military and served in India and he is nostalgic for his time there.
          He considers his service to be some of the best years of his life.
          Alison observes that her father is hurt because the present is not the
          past and that Jimmy is hurt because he feels the present is only the
          past. Alison begins to pack her toy squirrel, but then she decides not
          to do so.</span

          >Helena and Cliff soon enter the scene. Alison leaves a letter for
          Jimmy explaining why she has left and she gives it to Cliff. After
          Alison leaves, Cliff becomes angry and gives the letter to Helena,
          blaming her for the situation. Jimmy returns, bewildered that he was
          almost hit by Colonel Redfern&apos;s car and that Cliff pretended not
          to see him when he was walking by on the street. He reads
          Alison&apos;s letter and becomes very angry. Helena tells him that
          Alison is pregnant, but Jimmy tells her that he does not care. He
          insults Helena and she slaps him, then passionately kisses him.</span

          >Several months pass and the third act opens with Jimmy and Cliff once
          again reading the Sunday papers while Helena stands in the corner
          ironing. Jimmy and Cliff still engage in their angry banter and
          Helena&apos;s religious tendencies have taken the brunt of
          Jimmy&apos;s punishment. Jimmy and Cliff perform scenes from musicals
          and comedy shows but when Helena leaves, Cliff notes that things do
          not feel the same with her here. Cliff then tells Jimmy that he wants
          to move out of the apartment. Jimmy takes the news calmly and tells
          him that he has been a loyal friend and is worth more than any woman.
          When Helena returns, the three plan to go out. Alison suddenly
          enters.</span

          >Alison and Helena talk while Jimmy leaves the room. He begins to
          loudly play his trumpet. Alison has lost her baby and looks sick.
          Helena tells Alison that she should be angry with her for what she has
          done, but Alison is only grieved by the loss of her baby. Helena is
          driven to distraction by Jimmy&apos;s trumpet playing and demands that
          he come into the room. When he comes back in, he laments the fact that
          Alison has lost the baby but shrugs it off. Helena then tells Jimmy
          and Alison that her sense of morality -- right and wrong -- has not
          diminished and that she knows she must leave. Alison attempts to
          persuade her to&nbsp;</span

          Alison tells him that she has now gone through the emotional and
          physical suffering that he has always wanted her to feel. He realizes
          that she has suffered greatly, has become like him, and becomes softer
          and more tender towards her. The play ends with Jimmy and Alison
          embracing, once again playing their game of bear and squirrel.</span
