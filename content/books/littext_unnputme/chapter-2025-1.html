    <p id="isPasted"><strong>Settings</strong><br><strong>Physical:</strong> The story is set primarily in <em>Stardom
        Schools</em>, Lagos, a prestigious private institution symbolizing Mr. Bepo&rsquo;s dedication to education amid
      challenges like demanding parents, financial pressures, and staff tensions. Key events occur in the assembly hall,
      classrooms, and the MD&rsquo;s office. Other Lagos locations, like Mushin and Lekki, reflect Nigeria&rsquo;s
      socio-economic disparity, while <em>Badagry</em> evokes the history of slavery and its connection to modern
      migration. Natural sites like <em>Erin Ijesha Waterfalls</em> and <em>Ikogosi Warm Springs</em> celebrate
      Nigeria&rsquo;s beauty and heritage.</p>
    <p><strong>Temporal:</strong> Set in contemporary Nigeria, the novel addresses modern challenges like migration
      (&ldquo;Japa&rdquo;), high education costs, and bureaucratic inefficiencies, with global parallels such as brain
      drain.</p>
    <p><strong>Psychological:</strong> Mr. Bepo struggles with internal conflicts, including societal pressures to
      migrate, professional ambitions, and his dedication to his students. Tensions at Stardom Schools mirror the

    <h2> Chapter 1 (Dusk) </h2>

    <p id="isPasted">The principal of Stardom Schools, Mr. Bepo, shocked everyone during the morning assembly by walking
      unusually, crying uncontrollably, and being unable to speak. The vice principal, Mrs. Grace Apeh, dismissed the
      students and led him to his office, where he continued weeping for over 30 minutes. Rumors spread quickly among
      parents, prompting Mrs. Apeh to inform the Managing Director, Mrs. Ibidun Gloss, who returned to school to address
      the situation.</p>
    <p>The school had started the day celebrating a recent 90% WASSCE success rate and rewarding teachers, though two
      were reprimanded for poor student performance. Earlier, the school had also announced a reduction in boarding
      fees, leading to improved punctuality among students.</p>
    <p>Despite efforts by staff and a pastor, Mr. Bepo remained unresponsive. When attempts to reach his wife failed,
      the MD decided to send him home with the school&rsquo;s guidance counselor to ensure his safety, prioritizing his
      well-being and the school&rsquo;s reputation.</p>


    <h2> Chapter 2 (The Enticement) </h2>

    <p id="isPasted">Five days after his emotional breakdown, Mr. Bepo revealed the reason for his distress: he was
      relocating to the UK under pressure from his wife and children, despite his reluctance to leave his students and
      his plans for the future. His wife, a nurse earning &pound;10,000 monthly, and his new teaching job offering
      &pound;3,600 monthly made relocation financially appealing compared to his â‚¦400,000 salary in Nigeria.</p>
    <p>Known as &quot;The Lekki Headmaster&quot; for his empathetic conflict resolution skills, Mr. Bepo had served four
      years as headmaster of Stardom Kiddies and the rest as principal of the secondary school. His colleagues found his
      hesitation to embrace the &ldquo;golden opportunity&rdquo; to relocate amusing and ironic.</p>
    <p>Before the relocation, Bepo dreamed of retiring at 55, starting a school, or pursuing ventures like farming,
      transportation, or water production. However, these plans were now set aside as he prepared to join his family
      abroad for a new chapter of his life.</p>

    <h2> Chapter 3 (Migration Tales) </h2>

    <div data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="5472db3a-7f5c-4b7b-a870-9da7bff8e49f" dir="auto"
      data-message-model-slug="gpt-4o" id="isPasted">
      <p>Bepo eventually resolved to relocate and began listening to stories from others who had already made the move.
        He learned about the payment systems abroad, where salaries could be hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, unlike
        the fixed monthly pay common in Nigeria. Bepo particularly liked the hourly system, which allowed employees to
        change jobs more freely and employers to closely monitor performance. He believed this system encouraged
        accountability and contributed to the development of other countries.</p>
      <p>He discovered that skilled workers earned significantly higher wages abroad, with daily earnings ranging from
        $150 to $250, amounting to as much as $2400 per month. This was a stark contrast to the N1600 many Nigerians
        earned. Skilled professions such as nursing and medicine were particularly in demand, and thousands of health
        workers and graduates had been emigrating annually, with many utilizing education visas to relocate.</p>
      <p>Bepo also heard of desperate measures taken by some to fund their relocation. He recalled a colleague, Mr. Nku,
        who borrowed N2 million from the school&rsquo;s cooperative and relocated two days later, and a school driver
        who attempted to sell a bus to finance his son&#39;s education abroad.</p>
      <p>Sola, a former colleague who had relocated to the UK with her husband six months earlier, reassured Bepo about
        his transition since his wife was already there. She shared how she and her husband sold everything and borrowed
        N4 million to fund their journey. Sola explained that migrating couples often divide responsibilities, with one
        partner working while the other studies.</p>
      <p>The appeal of relocating also included opportunities for children to access free primary and secondary
        education and quality healthcare, especially for children who receive regular checkups. Bepo compared this to
        the high cost of education at Stardom, where parents paid millions in fees.</p>
      <p>However, the stories weren&rsquo;t always encouraging. Jare, a former banker, regretted relocating after
        finding himself caring for an elderly couple in London. Another man, Hope, an accountant pursuing a
        Master&rsquo;s degree in the UK, depended on his wife for financial support until she refused to continue. These
        experiences made Bepo reflect on life&rsquo;s unpredictability, recalling an Idoma proverb about how sugarcane
        and bitter leaves derive contrasting tastes from the same rain.</p>
      <p>The question of bringing dependents from Nigeria also arose. While some, like Riike, were eager to sponsor
        relatives abroad, others were hesitant, showing that everyone&rsquo;s journey was shaped by their unique
        circumstances.</p>
