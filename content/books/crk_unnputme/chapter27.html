<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Example of Eli and Samuel&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">The irresponsibility behavior of the sons of Eli&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Sam.2</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Hannah also prayed and said, &quot;My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in thy salvation.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] &quot;There is none holy like the LORD, there is none besides thee; there is no rock like our God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. TheThe barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. ForFor the pillars of the earth are the LORD&apos;S, and on them he has set the world.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] &quot;He will guard the feet of his faithful ones; but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might shall a man prevail.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Then Elka&apos;nah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the LORD, in the presence of Eli the priest.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they had no regard for the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&apos;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&apos;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &quot;Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And if the man said to him, &quot;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&quot; he would say, &quot;No, you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD; for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy girded with a linen ephod.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Then Eli would bless Elka&apos;nah and his wife, and say, &quot;The LORD give you children by this woman for the loan which she lent to the LORD&quot;; so then they would return to their home.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And he said to them, &quot;Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] If a man sins against a man, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?&quot; But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the LORD to slay them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, &quot;Thus the LORD has said, `I revealed myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings which I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves upon the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: `I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me for ever&apos;; but now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Behold, the days are coming, when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father&apos;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity which shall be bestowed upon Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] The man of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; and all the increase of your house shall die by the sword of men.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] And this which shall befall your two sons, Hophni and Phin&apos;ehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed for ever.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] And every one who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, &quot;Put me, I pray you, in one of the priest&apos;s places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.&quot;&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">The Call of Samuel</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Sam 3: 1-18</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down within the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Then the LORD called, &quot;Samuel! Samuel!&quot; and he said, &quot;Here I am!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] and ran to Eli, and said, &quot;Here I am, for you called me.&quot; But he said, &quot;I did not call; lie down again.&quot; So he went and lay down.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And the LORD called again, &quot;Samuel!&quot; And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, &quot;Here I am, for you called me.&quot; But he said, &quot;I did not call, my son; lie down again.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, &quot;Here I am, for you called me.&quot; Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &quot;Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, `Speak, LORD, for thy servant hears.&apos;&quot; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] And the LORD came and stood forth, calling as at other times, &quot;Samuel! Samuel!&quot; And Samuel said, &quot;Speak, for thy servant hears.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Then the LORD said to Samuel, &quot;Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one that hears it will tingle.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] On that day I will fulfil against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And I tell him that I am about to punish his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&apos;s house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering for ever.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] But Eli called Samuel and said, &quot;Samuel, my son.&quot; And he said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And Eli said, &quot;What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, &quot;It is the LORD; let him do what seems good to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Fulfilment of God&apos;s Judgement on Eli and his Family</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">(1 Samuel 4: 10 - 22)</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines; they encamped at Ebene&apos;zer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the field of battle.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, &quot;Why has the LORD put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin&apos;ehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] When the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, &quot;What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?&quot; And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] the Philistines were afraid; for they said, &quot;A god has come into the camp.&quot; And they said, &quot;Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Take courage, and acquit yourselves like men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; acquit yourselves like men and fight.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home; and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin&apos;ehas, were slain.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, &quot;What is this uproar?&quot; Then the man hastened and came and told Eli.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And the man said to Eli, &quot;I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.&quot; And he said, &quot;How did it go, my son?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] He who brought the tidings answered and said, &quot;Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people; your two sons also, Hophni and Phin&apos;ehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phin&apos;ehas, was with child, about to give birth. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth; for her pains came upon her.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, &quot;Fear not, for you have borne a son.&quot; But she did not answer or give heed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And she named the child Ich&apos;abod, saying, &quot;The glory has departed from Israel!&quot; because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And she said, &quot;The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">The Sins of the sons of Samuel and the Demand for a King</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1 Samuel 8: 1-9</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] The name of his first-born son was Jo&apos;el, and the name of his second, Abi&apos;jah; they were judges in Beer-sheba.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] and said to him, &quot;Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint for us a king to govern us like all the nations.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, &quot;Give us a king to govern us.&quot; And Samuel prayed to the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And the LORD said to Samuel, &quot;Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] According to all the deeds which they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Now then, hearken to their voice; only, you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking a king from him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] He said, &quot;These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] He will take your menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle and your asses, and put them to his work.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, &quot;No! but we will have a king over us,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And the LORD said to Samuel, &quot;Hearken to their voice, and make them a king.&quot; Samuel then said to the men of Israel, &quot;Go every man to his city.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now in the eighteenth year of King Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat, Abi&apos;jam began to reign over Judah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother&apos;s name was Ma&apos;acah the daughter of Abish&apos;alom.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And he walked in all the sins which his father did before him; and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] Nevertheless for David&apos;s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uri&apos;ah the Hittite.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Now there was war between Rehobo&apos;am and Jerobo&apos;am all the days of his life.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] The rest of the acts of Abi&apos;jam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abi&apos;jam and Jerobo&apos;am.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And Abi&apos;jam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] In the twentieth year of Jerobo&apos;am king of Israel Asa began to reign over Judah,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother&apos;s name was Ma&apos;acah the daughter of Abish&apos;alom.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] He also removed Ma&apos;acah his mother from being queen mother because she had an abominable image made for Ashe&apos;rah; and Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly true to the LORD all his days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And he brought into the house of the LORD the votive gifts of his father and his own votive gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And there was war between Asa and Ba&apos;asha king of Israel all their days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Ba&apos;asha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king&apos;s house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and King Asa sent them to Ben-ha&apos;dad the son of Tabrim&apos;mon, the son of He&apos;zi-on, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] &quot;Let there be a league between me and you, as between my father and your father: behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Ba&apos;asha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And Ben-ha&apos;dad hearkened to King Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, A&apos;bel-beth-ma&apos;acah, and all Chin&apos;neroth, with all the land of Naph&apos;tali.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And when Ba&apos;asha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he dwelt in Tirzah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Ba&apos;asha had been building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehosh&apos;aphat his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Nadab the son of Jerobo&apos;am began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Ba&apos;asha the son of Ahi&apos;jah, of the house of Is&apos;sachar, conspired against him; and Ba&apos;asha struck him down at Gib&apos;bethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gib&apos;bethon.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] So Ba&apos;asha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jerobo&apos;am; he left to the house of Jerobo&apos;am not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the LORD which he spoke by his servant Ahi&apos;jah the Shi&apos;lonite;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] it was for the sins of Jerobo&apos;am which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] And there was war between Asa and Ba&apos;asha king of Israel all their days.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Ba&apos;asha the son of Ahi&apos;jah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jerobo&apos;am and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] But in the third year Jehosh&apos;aphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And the king of Israel said to his servants, &quot;Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And he said to Jehosh&apos;aphat, &quot;Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?&quot; And Jehosh&apos;aphat said to the king of Israel, &quot;I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And Jehosh&apos;aphat said to the king of Israel, &quot;Inquire first for the word of the LORD.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, &quot;Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?&quot; And they said, &quot;Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] But Jehosh&apos;aphat said, &quot;Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] And the king of Israel said to Jehosh&apos;aphat, &quot;There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai&apos;ah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil.&quot; And Jehosh&apos;aphat said, &quot;Let not the king say so.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, &quot;Bring quickly Micai&apos;ah the son of Imlah.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] Now the king of Israel and Jehosh&apos;aphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sama&apos;ria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And Zedeki&apos;ah the son of Chena&apos;anah made for himself horns of iron, and said, &quot;Thus says the LORD, `With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, &quot;Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And the messenger who went to summon Micai&apos;ah said to him, &quot;Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] But Micai&apos;ah said, &quot;As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, &quot;Micai&apos;ah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?&quot; And he answered him, &quot;Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] But the king said to him, &quot;How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] And he said, &quot;I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, `These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And the king of Israel said to Jehosh&apos;aphat, &quot;Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And Micai&apos;ah said, &quot;Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?&apos; And one said one thing, and another said another.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I will entice him.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And the LORD said to him, `By what means?&apos; And he said, `I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.&apos; And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Then Zedeki&apos;ah the son of Chena&apos;anah came near and struck Micai&apos;ah on the cheek, and said, &quot;How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And Micai&apos;ah said, &quot;Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And the king of Israel said, &quot;Seize Micai&apos;ah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Jo&apos;ash the king&apos;s son;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] and say, `Thus says the king, &quot;Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace.&quot;&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And Micai&apos;ah said, &quot;If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.&quot; And he said, &quot;Hear, all you peoples!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] So the king of Israel and Jehosh&apos;aphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] And the king of Israel said to Jehosh&apos;aphat, &quot;I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.&quot; And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, &quot;Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh&apos;aphat, they said, &quot;It is surely the king of Israel.&quot; So they turned to fight against him; and Jehosh&apos;aphat cried out.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, &quot;Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] And about sunset a cry went through the army, &quot;Every man to his city, and every man to his country!&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] So the king died, and was brought to Sama&apos;ria; and they buried the king in Sama&apos;ria.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] And they washed the chariot by the pool of Sama&apos;ria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD which he had spoken.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahazi&apos;ah his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] Jehosh&apos;aphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] Jehosh&apos;aphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother&apos;s name was Azu&apos;bah the daughter of Shilhi.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] Jehosh&apos;aphat also made peace with the king of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh&apos;aphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] Jehosh&apos;aphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at E&apos;zion-ge&apos;ber.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] Then Ahazi&apos;ah the son of Ahab said to Jehosh&apos;aphat, &quot;Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,&quot; but Jehosh&apos;aphat was not willing.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] And Jehosh&apos;aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jeho&apos;ram his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] Ahazi&apos;ah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Sama&apos;ria in the seventeenth year of Jehosh&apos;aphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] He served Ba&apos;al and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.</span></p>
