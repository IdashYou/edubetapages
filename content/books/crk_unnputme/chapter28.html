  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] &quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] &quot;You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] &quot;You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] &quot;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Six days you shall labor, and do all your work;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your manservant, or your maidservant, or your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] &quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the LORD your God gives you.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] &quot;You shall not kill.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] &quot;You shall not commit adultery.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] Now when all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled; and they stood afar off,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] and said to Moses, &quot;You speak to us, and we will hear; but let not God speak to us, lest we die.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear; for God has come to prove you, and that the fear of him may be before your eyes, that you may not sin.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] And the people stood afar off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Thus you shall say to the people of Israel: `You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] And if you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you wield your tool upon it you profane it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.&apos;</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Gen.39: 7-12</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Pot&apos;i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ish&apos;maelites who had brought him down there.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] and his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hands.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian&apos;s house for Joseph&apos;s sake; the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in house and field.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] So he left all that he had in Joseph&apos;s charge; and having him he had no concern for anything but the food which he ate.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And after a time his master&apos;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, &quot;Lie with me.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] But he refused and said to his master&apos;s wife, &quot;Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] she caught him by his garment, saying, &quot;Lie with me.&quot; But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] she called to the men of her household and said to them, &quot;See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] and she told him the same story, saying, &quot;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, &quot;This is the way your servant treated me,&quot; his anger was kindled.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And Joseph&apos;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king&apos;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&apos;s care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph&apos;s care, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Genesis 40</span></em></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And one night they both dreamed -- the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison -- each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were troubled.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] So he asked Pharaoh&apos;s officers who were with him in custody in his master&apos;s house, &quot;Why are your faces downcast today?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] They said to him, &quot;We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.&quot; And Joseph said to them, &quot;Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, &quot;In my dream there was a vine before me,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] Pharaoh&apos;s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh&apos;s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh&apos;s hand.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Then Joseph said to him, &quot;This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh&apos;s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, &quot;I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And Joseph answered, &quot;This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head -- from you! -- and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] On the third day, which was Pharaoh&apos;s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh&apos;s hand;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Genesis 41</span></em></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows sleek and fat, and they fed in the reed grass.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And the gaunt and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] So in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharaoh.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, &quot;I remember my faults today.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard; and when we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Joseph answered Pharaoh, &quot;It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &quot;The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[31] and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[32] And the doubling of Pharaoh&apos;s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[33] Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[34] Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[35] And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[36] That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[37] This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[38] And Pharaoh said to his servants, &quot;Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[39] So Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[40] you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[41] And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[42] Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph&apos;s hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[43] and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, &quot;Bow the knee!&quot; Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[44] Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[45] And Pharaoh called Joseph&apos;s name Zaph&apos;enath-pane&apos;ah; and he gave him in marriage As&apos;enath, the daughter of Poti&apos;phera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[46] Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[47] During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[48] and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[49] And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[50] Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom As&apos;enath, the daughter of Poti&apos;phera priest of On, bore to him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[51] Joseph called the name of the first-born Manas&apos;seh, &quot;For,&quot; he said, &quot;God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father&apos;s house.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[52] The name of the second he called E&apos;phraim, &quot;For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[53] The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[54] and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[55] When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &quot;Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[56] So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[57] Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Sam.26: 1-12</span></em></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gib&apos;e-ah, saying, &quot;Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachi&apos;lah, which is on the east of Jeshi&apos;mon?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachi&apos;lah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshi&apos;mon. But David remained in the wilderness; and when he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] David sent out spies, and learned of a certainty that Saul had come.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Then David said to Ahim&apos;elech the Hittite, and to Jo&apos;ab&apos;s brother Abi&apos;shai the son of Zeru&apos;iah, &quot;Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?&quot; And Abi&apos;shai said, &quot;I will go down with you.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] So David and Abi&apos;shai went to the army by night; and there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay around him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Then said Abi&apos;shai to David, &quot;God has given your enemy into your hand this day; now therefore let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] But David said to Abi&apos;shai, &quot;Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the LORD&apos;S anointed, and be guiltless?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] And David said, &quot;As the LORD lives, the LORD will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] The LORD forbid that I should put forth my hand against the LORD&apos;S anointed; but take now the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul&apos;s head; and they went away. No man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then David went over to the other side, and stood afar off on the top of the mountain, with a great space between them;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] and David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, &quot;Will you not answer, Abner?&quot; Then Abner answered, &quot;Who are you that calls to the king?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] And David said to Abner, &quot;Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD&apos;S anointed. And now see where the king&apos;s spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Saul recognized David&apos;s voice, and said, &quot;Is this your voice, my son David?&quot; And David said, &quot;It is my voice, my lord, O king.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] And he said, &quot;Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What guilt is on my hands?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering; but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, `Go, serve other gods.&apos;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to seek my life, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then Saul said, &quot;I have done wrong; return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day; behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And David made answer, &quot;Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put forth my hand against the LORD&apos;S anointed.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] Then Saul said to David, &quot;Blessed be you, my son David!

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And the herald proclaimed aloud, &quot;You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,</span></p>

  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego. These men, O king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego be brought. Then they brought these men before the king.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Nebuchadnez&apos;zar said to them, &quot;Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up?</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego answered the king, &quot;O Nebuchadnez&apos;zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] Because the king&apos;s order was strict and the furnace very hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Then King Nebuchadnez&apos;zar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counselors, &quot;Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?&quot; They answered the king, &quot;True, O king.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] He answered, &quot;But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] Then Nebuchadnez&apos;zar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace and said, &quot;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here!&quot; Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego came out from the fire.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king&apos;s counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their mantles were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] Nebuchadnez&apos;zar said, &quot;Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at nought the king&apos;s command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[30] Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed&apos;nego in the province of Babylon.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Esther Obedience to Mordecai</span></strong></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Esther Agrees to Help the Jews</span></em></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Esther 4: 1-16</span></em></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;[1] When Mor&apos;decai learned all that had been done, Mor&apos;decai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] he went up to the entrance of the king&apos;s gate, for no one might enter the king&apos;s gate clothed with sackcloth.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] And in every province, wherever the king&apos;s command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] When Esther&apos;s maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mor&apos;decai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king&apos;s eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mor&apos;decai to learn what this was and why it was.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] Hathach went out to Mor&apos;decai in the open square of the city in front of the king&apos;s gate,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] and Mor&apos;decai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&apos;s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] Mor&apos;decai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and charge her to go to the king to make supplication to him and entreat him for her people.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And Hathach went and told Esther what Mor&apos;decai had said.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mor&apos;decai, saying,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] &quot;All the king&apos;s servants and the people of the king&apos;s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law; all alike are to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live. And I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] And they told Mor&apos;decai what Esther had said.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] Then Mor&apos;decai told them to return answer to Esther, &quot;Think not that in the king&apos;s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father&apos;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Then Esther told them to reply to Mor&apos;decai,</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] &quot;Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.&quot;</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Mor&apos;decai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.</span></p>
  <p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
