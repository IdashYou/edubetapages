<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">Ahab seizes Naboth&apos;s vineyard</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">1Kings 21: 1-16</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Sama&apos;ria.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] And after this Ahab said to Naboth, &quot;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] But Naboth said to Ahab, &quot;The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, &quot;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&quot; And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] But Jez&apos;ebel his wife came to him, and said to him, &quot;Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And he said to her, &quot;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, `Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it&apos;; and he answered, `I will not give you my vineyard.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And Jez&apos;ebel his wife said to him, &quot;Do you now govern Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] So she wrote letters in Ahab&apos;s name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who dwelt with Naboth in his city.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] And she wrote in the letters, &quot;Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] and set two base fellows opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, `You have cursed God and the king.&apos; Then take him out, and stone him to death.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jez&apos;ebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters which she had sent to them,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] And the two base fellows came in and sat opposite him; and the base fellows brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &quot;Naboth cursed God and the king.&quot; So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death with stones.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] Then they sent to Jez&apos;ebel, saying, &quot;Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] As soon as Jez&apos;ebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jez&apos;ebel said to Ahab, &quot;Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Then the word of the LORD came to Eli&apos;jah the Tishbite, saying,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] &quot;Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Sama&apos;ria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD, &quot;Have you killed, and also taken possession?&quot;&apos; And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD: &quot;In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.&quot;&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Ahab said to Eli&apos;jah, &quot;Have you found me, O my enemy?&quot; He answered, &quot;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] and I will make your house like the house of Jerobo&apos;am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba&apos;asha the son of Ahi&apos;jah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And of Jez&apos;ebel the LORD also said, `The dogs shall eat Jez&apos;ebel within the bounds of Jezreel.&apos;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] Any one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] (There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jez&apos;ebel his wife incited.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] He did very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] And when Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[28] And the word of the LORD came to Eli&apos;jah the Tishbite, saying,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[29] &quot;Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son&apos;s days I will bring the evil upon his house.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><strong class="w3-text-green"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">Gehazi&apos;s Greed and it&apos;s Consequences</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><em><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-style:italic;font-size:16px;">2Kings 5: 1-27</span></em></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[1] Na&apos;aman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[2] Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid from the land of Israel, and she waited on Na&apos;aman&apos;s wife.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[3] She said to her mistress, &quot;Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Sama&apos;ria! He would cure him of his leprosy.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[4] So Na&apos;aman went in and told his lord, &quot;Thus and so spoke the maiden from the land of Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[5] And the king of Syria said, &quot;Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[6] And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, &quot;When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Na&apos;aman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[7] And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, &quot;Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[8] But when Eli&apos;sha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, &quot;Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[9] So Na&apos;aman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door of Eli&apos;sha&apos;s house.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[10] And Eli&apos;sha sent a messenger to him, saying, &quot;Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[11] But Na&apos;aman was angry, and went away, saying, &quot;Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[12] Are not Aba&apos;na and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?&quot; So he turned and went away in a rage.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[13] But his servants came near and said to him, &quot;My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, `Wash, and be clean&apos;?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[14] So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[15] Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, &quot;Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[16] But he said, &quot;As the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will receive none.&quot; And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[17] Then Na&apos;aman said, &quot;If not, I pray you, let there be given to your servant two mules&apos; burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[18] In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[19] He said to him, &quot;Go in peace.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">But when Na&apos;aman had gone from him a short distance,</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[20] Geha&apos;zi, the servant of Eli&apos;sha the man of God, said, &quot;See, my master has spared this Na&apos;aman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him, and get something from him.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[21] So Geha&apos;zi followed Na&apos;aman. And when Na&apos;aman saw some one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, &quot;Is all well?&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[22] And he said, &quot;All is well. My master has sent me to say, `There have just now come to me from the hill country of E&apos;phraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.&apos;&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[23] And Na&apos;aman said, &quot;Be pleased to accept two talents.&quot; And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them before Geha&apos;zi.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[24] And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[25] He went in, and stood before his master, and Eli&apos;sha said to him, &quot;Where have you been, Geha&apos;zi?&quot; And he said, &quot;Your servant went nowhere.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[26] But he said to him, &quot;Did I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?</span></p>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="myfont1" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';line-height:150%;font-size:16px;">[27] Therefore the leprosy of Na&apos;aman shall cleave to you, and to your descendants for ever.&quot; So he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</span></p>
