        <p><strong>LEARNING FROM FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>"It is inevitable that some defeat will enter even the most victorious life. The human spirit is never finished when it is defeated... it is finished when it surrenders." - Ben Stein</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"Failure is a part of success. There is no such thing as a bed of roses all your life. But failure will never stand in the way of success if you learn from it." - Hank Aaron</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Persistence is what makes the impossible possible, the possible likely, and the likely definite." -Robert Half</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we can transcend it." - M. Scott Peck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A stumbling block to the pessimist is a stepping stone to the optimist." - Eleanor Roosevelt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail." - Napoleon Hill</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"A life spent in making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing." - George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"There are no hopeless situations; there are only people who have grown hopeless about them." - Clare Boothe</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"One's dignity may be assaulted, vandalized and cruelly mocked, but cannot be taken away unless it is surrendered." - Michael J. Fox</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"People who consider themselves victims of their circumstances will always remain victims unless they develop a greater vision for their lives." - Stedman Graham</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever." - Lance Armstrong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No success is linear, there will always be bumps in the road." - Jack Welch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Forget about the consequences of failure. Failure is only a temporary change in direction to set you straight for your next success." - Denis Waitley</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be greater than anything that can happen to you." - Norman Vincent Peale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." --Thomas A. Edison</p>
