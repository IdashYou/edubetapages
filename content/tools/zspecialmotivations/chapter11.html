        <p><strong>MOTIVATING YOURSELF TO STUDY</strong></p>
<p>If you find that you lack motivation to study, don&rsquo;t feel bad, it&rsquo;s a normal thing. Just about every student experience this problem at one time in their life.</p>
<p>Motivation is important for good studying. When you are motivated, you will find it easy to stay</p>
<p>focused over a period of time. When you are not motivated, you will not only find it difficult to</p>
<p>stay focused, but you will find it difficult to get started in the first place. The secret about motivation is to keep on being motivated (activation). This is why people sa&nbsp;&nbsp;y that it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to increase your motivation to study.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reward yourself for studying. For example, after a successful study session, have a treat</li>
</ol>
<p>like a nice big ice cream cone, biscuit, sweet etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Study with your friends. Don&rsquo;t make it party or discussion time, but you can have fun as you do this. It&rsquo;s not for everybody but it works for some people.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remind yourself of your long-term goals (profession, money, etc.). Achievement of your goals likely requires educational success. Educational success requires studying.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Eliminate distractions. If you are surrounded by things you would rather do than study, you will probably do those things instead of studying. Off your phone data. Freeze your social media app or put your phone in airplane mode if you can. The app doesn&rsquo;t need internet access so go on.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Develop interest in what you have to study. This will make studying more enjoyable. Find something you will like in the course. Maybe you don&rsquo;t like chemistry and you want to be a Nurse; you need to know about drugs to treat patient and chemistry will help you. So, you don&rsquo;t have option. You want to study Economics and you don&rsquo;t like English. Remember that if you don&rsquo;t speak good English your village people will laugh at you. So, this is how interest comes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Take breaks. When you feel that you need to take a break, try to stop at a point where it is logical to stop. This will make it easier for you to resume studying after your break.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Establish a comfortable environment. You will be more inclined to study if you feel comfortable.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Establish reasonable goals for a study session. You probably won&rsquo;t get very far if you look at your study session as "mission impossible."</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Use a motivational quote in the app. You can also read inspirational stories about real people who have achieved success through effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Just do it. Once you do, you will feel a lot better than if you are worried about getting it done. Motivation is your friend. Stay motivated.</li>
</ol>

<p>"Education is not academics but the ability of the human life to experience his environment, question it deep enough to find the options that exist in it and know the ones to embrace."~ Olakunle Soriyan</p>

<p>"Mindfulness places us where choice is possible; the greater our awareness, the greater our freedom to choose." - Gil Fronsdal</p>
