        <p><strong>SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If success is cheap, everyone would have been successful, if the road to success was straight many would have been enjoying success long ago.</p>
<p>But am sorry, it&rsquo;s not! If you are expecting your dreams to come through cheaply, then you need a change of mind. Success is not for people who give up easily, it&rsquo;s not for lazy people, it&rsquo;s not for people who give excuses.</p>
<p>Success comes to men who are dedicated, committed and ready to give their dreams all it takes to be fulfilled. So, I ask again, what manner of person are you? Someone who gives up easily? Or someone ready to fight through the bad day to earn the days? Think about it!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Success is not an entitlement. It has to be earned." - Howard Schultz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Success is a little like wrestling with a gorilla. You don't quit when you're tired -- you quit when the gorilla is tired." - Robert Strauss</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy." --Tony Robbins</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do. Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better." --Jim Rohn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously</p>
<p>consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them." --Denis Waitley</p>
