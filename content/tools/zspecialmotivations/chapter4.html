        <p><strong>FOCUS</strong></p>
<p>"Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus." - Alexander Graham Bell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays, but never lose sight of your goal. Prepare yourself in every way you can by increasing your knowledge and adding to your experience, so that you can make the most of opportunity when it occurs." - Mario Andretti</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude." - Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Great works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance." - Samuel Johnson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men." - Thomas Fuller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There is something greater and purer than what the mouth utters. Silence illuminates our souls, whispers to our hearts, and brings them together. Silence separates us from ourselves, makes us sail the firmament of spirit, and brings us closer to heaven." - Kahlil Gibran</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital." - Joe Paterno</p>
