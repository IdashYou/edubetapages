<p><strong>HOME SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The developments in science and technology has tremendously developed the field of Home Science within the last few decades in both its outreach and its depth of penetration in order to meet the dynamic nature of the problems and challenges of individuals, families and societies. The real depth of the significant link between nutrition and disease, and role of nutrition in patients&rsquo; care is being increasingly recognized. The complexity of human nature and the need for optimum use of the human and natural resources in his environment for good health has generated compelling need for the existence/establishment of departments with programmes related to Home Science, Nutrition and Dietetics in the country. Home Science students are engaged in applied field of study that brings together knowledge and skills from different disciplines within the pure and applied arts and sciences to solve the most pressing problems that challenge the families presently, as well as those that are possibly going to emerge in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Brief History</strong></h3>
<p>The Department of Home Science, Nutrition and Dietetics runs two-degree programmes but now splited into Nutrition and Dietetics &amp; Home Science. It consists of four broad fields (Nutrition and Dietetics, Home Management, Family and Child Studies, and Textiles and Fashion Design) with varied career opportunities geared towards optimum utilization of agro-products, human and material resources to enhance quality of life. Each field has developed tremendously in the last few decades as a result of development in science and technology, all of which have affected lifestyles and living conditions of individuals, families and society at large. Both programmes are designed to provide broad- practical and theoretical education that would enable students function effectively in their capacity as privately employed individuals, government workers, researchers, consultant, change agents, workers in national and international agencies and corporate bodies. The programmes are multidisciplinary, cutting across the boundaries of several disciplines namely: social sciences, humanities, arts, physical and biological sciences, agriculture, food science, applied medical and management sciences. An important aspect of these programme is the opportunity provided for students to gain direct practical experience through periods of attachment in the food industries, hotels, hospitals, childcare centers and research centers. Students of Nutrition and Dietetics are, however, engaged in a broad multi-disciplinary study bridging the gap between the areas of Food Science, Applied Medical Science and Management Studies. In addition, they are further encouraged to undergo the one-year internship programme as a private arrangement until it is properly streamlined between the University and the professional body (Dietitians Association of Nigeria). On completion, the Nutrition and Dietetics programme therefore offers students the opportunity to acquire basic knowledge and skills required before graduation. In practice, the activities involve education, research, prevention and therapy in nutrition-related areas aimed primarily at improving or maintaining good health throughout the lifestyle.</p>

<h1><strong>AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>About</strong></h3>
<p>The founders of the University of Nigeria believed that there was need to train Nigerian Youths locally, and in sufficient numbers, for the formidable task of disseminating useful and practical information from the research base to the rural farm families for sustainability food production. Agricultural Extension is based on the philosophy that rural people are intelligent, capable and desirous of receiving information and making use of it for their individual and community welfare. It is purely voluntary and democratic in its approach to people. It is truly anchored on the principle of working with the rural farm families where they are, build on what they have, add to what they know and enabling them to develop themselves. The underlying philosophy of the programme therefore, is to produce graduates who will be theoretically and practically knowledgeable in agricultural production and rural life.</p>
<h3><strong>Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>The primary objectives of the programme are to:<br />1. conduct research and to provide a comprehensive and adequate programme of higher education for leaders in the field of agricultural extension and rural development;<br />2. improve the quality of rural life of the people in the neighboring communities throughout-reach programmes, for example, the Okpuje Project;<br />3. create a favorable teaching learning process that will facilitate a mastery of the concepts, principles, theories, positive attitude, aspiration and skills needed to effectively disseminate innovations (improved technologies, practices and systems) to the rural farm-families;<br />4. generate a set of new future farmers and farmers wives who can positively influence agricultural and rural development policies; and<br />5. generate graduates who can practicalise the skills and knowledge gained during practical year by engaging in farming enterprises after leaving school, and demonstrating that farming is a profitable venture.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope</strong></h3>
<p>The programme commences with the understanding of relevant branches of the natural and management sciences which form the basis of a co-ordinated sequence of applied courses offered in the penultimate and final years. An essential feature of the programme is that opportunities are provided for students to gain a broad training in the basic agricultural sciences in the first three years, and a full year practical training, during the fourth year of the programme, while the fifth or final year is the year of specialization. The requirements for the degree thus include the completion of the general studies programme of the University, required ancillary courses, necessary electives and the completion of specialized courses in Agricultural Extension.</p>

<p><strong>FOREIGN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The Department was first established in 1960 under the name, Department of Languages. It offered French as the major degree programme and German, Russian and Spanish as subsidiaries. Subsequently, the department was renamed Department of Foreign Languages and then later, Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Spanish was then phased out because of staff recruitment difficulties and apparent lack of desired interest by the Spanish Embassy in Nigeria. On the other hand, German and Russian grew to become full degree or combined degree programmes.</p>
<p>The philosophy of the programme is based on the imperative need to produce educated citizens capable of communicating effectively in French, German and Russian, and thus to make it possible for Nigeria to participate fully, without any linguistic inhibition, in international peace and understanding, trade and world politics. This shall be achieved through imparting skills in speaking, reading, and writing, translating and interpreting these foreign languages, and through the knowledge of the respective cultures and literatures. In other words, the department is poised to prepare generations of Nigerians who are adequately trained to adapt in the rest of the world, thereby reinforcing Nigeria&rsquo;s belief in the brotherhood of nations.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The programme is designed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Equip students with basic skills in listening, reading, speaking, writing, translating and interpreting through study of the relevant languages: French, German and Russian.</li>
<li>Produce Nigerian students, businessmen and women, civil servants, teachers and other professionals capable of interacting in the above languages and competent enough to work anywhere in the world in this era of globalization.</li>
<li>Reinforce the Nigerian belief in the brotherhood of Nations.</li>
<li>Enhance understanding and productivity in various fields of education and socioeconomic, political and cultural sectors of the Nigerian economy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The duration of the Department&rsquo;s degree programmes is four years for candidates who gain admission by Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME and three years for those who gain admission by Direct Entry. However French/German, French/Russian and other combinations are four-year programmes for all categories of admitted candidates. The department also has a one-year preparatory programme in French which aims at preparing candidates intensively for entry into the 100 level of the regular degree programme, after a successful completion of the preparatory programme.</p>
<p>The third year of the proposed four-year programme by UTME or the second year of the three-year DE programme (Generally known as the Year Abroad Programme) can be spent partly or entirely in Nigeria at the French Language Village, Badagry, Goethe Institute, Lagos, or in a French, German or Russian speaking country, where the chosen language is an indigenous medium of communication. Durations are recommended as follows:</p>
<p>Candidates wishing to combine two foreign languages within the department, example, French/German French/Russian etc. are expected to spend one semester only for each of the languages. If, however a student desires to spend two semesters in any particular language area, French, German, and Russia, he/she shall be prepared to put in one extra academic year.</p>
<p>Combined Arts candidates wishing to combine other Faculty courses with a departmental based language, example, French/English, shall spend one semester only for the language immersion programme.</p>
<p>Candidates wishing to combine Education with a departmental based language shall spend one academic year of two semesters for their language immersion programme.</p>

<p><strong>ENGLISH AND LITERARY STUDIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The relation between literary art, language, and thought has been known, discussed, and researched into at least since Aristotle. The approach to teaching and in-depth exploration of English language structure and the nature, functioning, and manifestations of the literary is hinged on the idea that this knowledge is irreplaceable for language and literary workers. Thus, exposed to the working of language and literature the student grows in clarity of thought and perception, and develops the minds creative capabilities. This is one of the reasons why the graduates of English language and literary studies find employment in a vast range of activities in the service industry as well as in the management and productive sectors of the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The main objectives of the programmes in the department are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) To produce graduates who have a well-informed literary sensibility which enables them to respond in a creative manner to their environment.</li>
<li>b) To produce graduates who have such linguistic competence that will make them skilful users of the English Language.</li>
<li>c) To produce graduates who can exploit the rich resources of language for a sharper literary appreciation.</li>
<li>d) To equip the graduates with adequate knowledge of the full range of the major land-marks in English and African literature in all genres and periods.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The various programmes available to students in the Department of English and Literary Studies are designed to give them a rich and rounded humanistic education as well as practical competence in the language of science, business, and international relations in the modern world and to expose them to literary art in all its forms as it has evolved over time and as encountered in different places and cultures as well as the theoretical discourse that accompanies and assists in its development.</p>
<p>The Department of English offers a four-year B.A. Standard Degree Programme by entrance examination, a four-year B.A. Combined Honours Standard Degree Programme by entrance examination, and a three-year B.A. Standard Degree Programme by direct entry.</p>

<p><strong>ARCHEOLOGY AND TOURISM</strong></p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>The history of Archaeology in the University could be traced back to 1963, when Prof. D. D. Hartle was hired. Initially, Hartle was given a laboratory in the then Science Faculty Building. Subsequently, for some obscure reasons, he moved base from the Faculty of Science to the Faculty of Arts where archaeology became subsumed under the Department of History. Given the scientific nature of the discipline and the resultant disagreement between archaeologists and historians, it became clear that archaeology with its scientific methodology needed a separate existence. It was also hoped that this separation would enable the department to grow more rapidly. This dream was realized on August 1, 1981, when the Department of Archaeology was created. It began with a B.A. Combined Honours Programme, and in 1985, the Single Honours Programme was introduced. In an attempt to bring the departmental programme in line with current trends in Archaeology as well as the desire to equip students to face the challenges posed by todays globalized environment, the department of Archaeology in 2004 developed an embracing curriculum leading to B.A. Hons in Archaeology and B.A. Hons in Tourism.</p>
<p>The programme has currently been revised into an inclusive B.A. (Hons) Degree in Archaeology and Tourism. Thus, the Department of Archaeology and Tourism presents a revised undergraduate programme leading to B.A (HONS) degree in Archaeology and Tourism. Archaeology could be combined with the following subjects as both four-year and three-year Honours Degree programme: History, Linguistics, Languages, Fine and Applied Arts, Religion, Sociology/Anthropology, Philosophy, Geography, Geology, Botany.</p>
<p>In addition to courses taught through formal lectures, students are required to do supervised laboratory practical and undertake at least three field trips, which involve participation in Archaeology or a combined discipline. Those offering the B.A. (Honours) Degree in Archaeology and Tourism are also required to undertake a minimum of two internship programmes to qualify for the award of the degree.</p>
<p>The department offers service courses to departments in the Faculty of Education, and to Departments of History, Fine and Applied Arts and other interested departments that may require some knowledge of the subject. For example, Fundamentals of Archaeology, Theory and Methods in Archaeology, Human Evolution, etc., give some insight of what Archaeology is all about.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The emerging realization of the relationship between Archaeology and Tourism and their values in today&rsquo;s society has motivated the department to develop programmes in the disciplines.</p>
<p>The programmes focus on the development of knowledge, skills and values for undergraduate students to enable them to handle heritage and tourism-related matters. The above philosophy informs the decision of the Department to offer courses that will enhance students&rsquo; proficiency in these areas of human pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The courses are designed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>equip students for careers in schools, Heritage Institutions, Museums, Arts Councils, Ministries, Tourism Corporations and Boards, Hotels and related areas.</li>
<li>prepare students for postgraduate programmes/researches.</li>
<li>enhance students&rsquo; competency in tourism, archaeology and heritage management and build their capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The courses cover Archaeology, Tourism and related areas in the humanities with special emphasis on Africa.</p>
<p><strong>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>(A) FOUR-YEAR PROGRAMME:</strong></p>
<p>Candidates coming into the four-year programme must have obtained five credits including English Language and any science subject as well as a Pass in Mathematics at WASC or GCE O/L or its equivalence.</p>

<p><strong>FINE AND APPLIED ART</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brief History of The Department</strong></p>
<p>The Department was founded in 1961 with nearly all the art teachers being British or American. They instituted the Western academic approach of naturalism, which promoted pictorial observational realism. This brand of Western academic pedagogy was effectively terminated when the expatriate art teachers left because of the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970). After the civil war, students and faculty members reassembled and resolved that the art programme of the Department had to be reconstructed to meet the demand of the new Nigerian society. From this period, a new culture of exploration and experimentation of the local environment in art teaching and learning dominated art activities of the school. Staff and students searched deeply into the nature and purpose of art and design in their communities as well as applying the proceeds of these intellectual and artistic endeavours into social and technological development. The content of the art programme made room for the incorporation of indigenous ideas, motifs, designs and styles into art learning and production. With this goal in mind, the Department developed and popularized Igbo patterns for body and wall painting known as Uli. Uli Art paved way for the emergence of a completely new visual vocabulary in the Department. Thus, the art programme moved away from Western style of naturalism to more abstract expressions and other stylistic changes that responded appropriately to the art experience in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Reaction against external academic art was challenged in favour of Nigerian forms. This created both contemporary and modern art, while accommodating new ideas. The effects of the new ideology were immense. Great efforts and enthusiasm were expanded to permeate this new concept into various sections of the Department, namely Sculpture, Painting, Ceramics, Textile and Visual Communication Designs.</p>
<p>The Department runs three types of programmes for the award of Bachelors degree in Fine and Applied Arts: Four-year, Three-year and Two-year standard programmes.</p>
<p>1st year of the three-year programme starts at 2nd year level. Thereafter, students follow the regular Four-Year programme at the 3rd year level.</p>
<p>Two-year standard programme follows the regular four-year programme at the 3rd year level.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The course of study in this Department has been devised to enable our youths re-discover themselves and dedicate their lives anew to the building of a strong nation. The discipline develops and exposes the students to multi-disciplinary dimensions of traditional and modern arts in order to produce the needed high-level manpower in the country. The programme prepares students for self-employment and to occupy high level academic positions in the various levels of educational institutions, research institutes and the cultural sectors of the nation&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The broad objectives of the programme are to:</p>
<p>-Produce well-trained and highly motivated students who are equipped to embark on a successful career in Fine and Applied Arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Promote excellence in studio practices in Ceramics, Visual Communication Design, Textile Design, Fashion Design, Painting and Sculpture. The Art History and Art Education programmes are well-balanced to provide the students with broad and balanced theoretical background so that they can function effectively in disseminating information as well as promoting Nigerian artistic and cultural heritage.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The programme leads to the award of Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Fine and Applied Arts in the following areas: Art Education, Art History, Ceramics, Fashion Design, Graphics, Painting, Sculpture, and Textile Design. For the standard four and three-year undergraduate programmes, the students are first introduced to the multi-disciplinary perspective of Fine and Applied Arts and, thereafter, exposed to the areas of specialization. Participation of students in the Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is compulsory.</p>
<p><strong>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>MASS COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p>History of The Department of Mass Communication</p>
<p>In 1961 history was made in sub-Saharan Africa when a Department of Mass Communication, then known as the Jackson College of Journalism was established at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka with a virtually north American style of school of journalism curriculum including heavy doses of advertising and public relations. The initiative to set up the department was that of the founding father of the university, the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the doyen of West African journalism. With the establishment of the department, the dream for formal educational training for journalists and would-be journalists became a reality.</p>
<p>In September 1961, the department, which was then named Jackson College of Journalism, was opened, and the first to head it was Mr. Earl Roe, who incidentally was the only lecturer in the department at that time. It was Mr. Roe who commenced journalism programme for the pioneer students of the department.</p>
<p>In early 1962 barely two years after its establishment, the Jackson College took a giant stride in the field of student journalism by launching the Nsukka Record a weekly newspaper. The idea was to provide a training ground for student journalists so that they would be properly groomed in the nitty-gritty of journalism, namely information, education and entertainment.</p>
<p>In June 1964, Zik&rsquo;s dream was eventually actualized with the graduation of four of the pioneer students of the college, the first in sub-Saharan Africa. The accomplishment of this goal was highly significant in view of the human and material resources problems that marked the beginning and progression of the college.</p>
<p>In May 1964, the College had organized a dinner to mark the graduation event, which, going by its significance, was an event of epochal magnitude. On that historic occasion, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, said, inter alia:</p>
<p>We are making history tonight in that we have gathered here to honour the prospective graduates of the Jackson College of Journalism who will receive their baccalaureate degrees in a few days. This incident will be history in the making, because for the first time in the annals of West Africa an indigenous university will endorse the professional competence of journalists who have passed through the crucibles of systematic university education.</p>
<p>In 1965 the department graduated 10 students. In 1966 it produced 12 graduates, and in 1967, just on the eve of the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War, it graduated 15 students. This progress was, however, momentarily halted by the ravages of the Civil War, which reduced the College to a shadow of its former self by robbing it of its entire facilities and founding academic staff.</p>
<p>The college came back to life once more in 1967 after the Civil War with its own products as new academic staff. This time the name Jackson College of Journalism was replaced with the Department of Mass Communication to reflect the department&rsquo;s new course offerings. To complete the newness circuit, the departmental newspaper. The Nsukka Record was revived in 1971 with the name The Record. The year 1971 was another milestone on the road to progress because it marked the production of the department&rsquo;s first batch of post-war graduates after the wreckage of the war.</p>
<p>The Name Jackson</p>
<p>The department was originally named the Jackson College of Journalism in homage to John Payne Jackson, a courageous newspaper editor, who founded the Lagos Weekly Record in 1891. A daring journalist, Jackson used his newspaper to attack the exploitative and obnoxious policies of the colonial government.</p>
<p>When John Payne Jackson died in 1915, his son Horatio Jackson took over the newspaper and continued in the footsteps of his father. It was in appreciation of the monumental contributions of the Jacksons that the department was named Jackson College of Journalism.</p>
<p>Post-war Performance</p>
<p>As earlier noted, the year 1971 represents an important milestone in the annals of the department in that it marked the beginning of the blossoming of the department into a gigantic school of mass communication. In April 1978, a departmental magazine, the Midworld, was born and in 2006, the name of the magazine was changed to The Jacksonite. From that year to date the performance of the department could be likened to an inverted pyramid denoting a mustard seed growth pattern.</p>
<p>In 1990 the department made a detailed review of its academic programme in response to the demands of the standard of the National Universities Commission (NUC). The elaborate review further enriched the curriculum with innovative offerings in print and electronic journalism, marketing communications, philosophy of communication, history and development of mass media systems with particular reference to the Nigerian mass media, law and ethics of mass communication, mass communication research and theories and photojournalism. These course areas and others are continually being enriched with latest studies.</p>
<p>The department has a pace-setting tradition, which has continued to power it to lofty heights in mass communication. Accordingly, the department revised its undergraduate programme again in 2008 to accommodate the demands of new</p>
<p>communication technologies, which were in fact attempting to redefine mass communication. The department&rsquo;s newspaper editing laboratory thus became fully computerized in 2008.</p>
<p>In 2006, the department started PGD and Ph.D programmes and revised its Masters programme. In 2007, the department acquired fully digitized radio and TV studios. In 2010 two professors joined the department at once, with a couple others from already existing staff aspiring to that zenith. In the same 2010 the department obtained full accreditation for the first time ever.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the Department of Mass Communication of UNN has been living up to its expectations in the competitive field of communication merchandising. The bi-focal role of the department as a pioneer and pace-setter in sub-Saharan African journalism becomes clearer when one realizes that the department was the lone-ranger until the middle 60&rsquo;s when the University of Lagos joined it in offering degree programme in journalism. Who could imagine that a new department, which started without a building (even when was eventually provided has to use the floor for furniture) could start and never stop. What could engineer such a progress except resolute determination arising from the insight of a visionary Zik of Africa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THEATRE AND FILM STUDIES</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Theatre and Film Studies, also known as the Robeson School of Dramatics is named after renowned African America actor Paul Robeson. It started as Sub-Department of Dramatic Arts which came into effect after the approval by the Senate at its 138th meeting held on July 6, 1983 in the Continuing Education Centre, UNN. Before this approval, Drama was offered as a stress area for the B.A. English degree in the Department of English. This goes as far back as 1965.</p>
<p>The Dramatic Arts programme, referred to by the founding fathers of the university as the Robeson College of Dramatics, was provided for, building-wise, as one of the pioneer disciplines of the University of Nigeria at its inception in 1960 but because of staffing problems, the discipline was attached for a long time to the Department of English as a stress area. It was not until the 1982/83 academic session that Dramatic Arts was upgraded to a Sub-Department level thereby making it quasi-independent and giving it positive encouragement to run its own programmes and administration. From that time onwards, the Department began to award a degree in Dramatic Arts, and the Co-ordinator of Dramatic Arts became a member of the University Senate. Both the Joint Universities Action Committee (JUAC) 1966, the predecessor of the present-day N.U.C., and the N.U.C have in their separate reports endorsed the Dramatic Arts discipline in the University of Nigeria. The Department achieved a full departmental status in 2004.</p>
<p>The Department of Theatre Arts can boast of a high rate of retention for both staff and students. From an academic strength of 3 in 1981/82 the number rose to 10 in 1983/84 and 14 in 1984/85. Today, we have a total of 10 academic, 3 technical and 3 support (administrative) staff. Correspondingly our student admission rose from 10 in 1983/84 to 95 in 1989/90 academic year to 220 presently. Our graduation figures rose from 3 in 1986/87 to an expected figure of 62 in the present academic year. The current population of postgraduate students is over forty.</p>
<p>The Theatre and Film Studies programme at the University of Nigeria offers four years of formal studies (for JME entrants) and three years (for Direct entry candidates). The Email. Theatre.filmstudies@unn.edu.ng</p>
<p>programme combines a strong theoretical base with practical technical and management studies. There is an option for industrial attachment but practical work is mandatory within the departmental through dramatic productions for students. Field visits to selected organizations and locations are also undertaken. Theatre Laboratory, a three-level course, is used to assess the practical activities of students.</p>

<p><strong><u>FACULTY OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>BIOCHEMISTRY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The discovery that the laws of nature which determined the movement of matter were also applicable in living things led to the rapid growth of Biochemistry as one of the major Sciences of modern times. That the same chemical reactions in vitro can occur in organisms to generate chemical energy to drive the sustenance and evolutionary development of organisms led to the discovery and illumination of various metabolic pathways. Proteins, Carbohydrates and Lipids consumed as food items from the environment are broken down to various intermediates and products that are used by organisms to maintain regular homeostasis, as well as the use and storage of chemical energy through the High energy (anhydride) bonds of Adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP). A greater insight into the structure and function of various macromolecules such as haemoglobin, insulin, enzymes and nucleic acids &mdash; their fascinating dual roles in diseases hereditary, transmission, transcription, regulation and translation &mdash; have opened up new and unprecedented vistas for modern industry.</p>
<p>For students, lecturers and researchers in the University of Nigeria, Department of Biochemistry, we have never lost site that Biochemistry truly reveals the inter dependence of matter, organisms, and their environment. This unity of matter lay a great sense of responsibility on humanity to take good care of the environment.</p>
<p>While the objectives of the Department of Biochemistry remain to ensure that our students are taught the core knowledge of Biochemistry from the more philosophical quest on the origin of life and research practices up to, its present frontiers, that is limited by available financial and technological resources, the Department &mdash; its academic staff, students and technical staff &mdash; strongly recognize the central role of Biochemistry to national industrialization, the transformation of the environment towards a life &ndash; friendly and greener economy. Indeed, Biochemistry does have a key role in the reduction of poverty, the elimination of hunger and above all maintaining a healthy population devoid of the havoc of infections and controllable genetic diseases.</p>
<p>For instance, through its research activities, the Department had not only invented a rapid means of screening sickle cell genotypes but potential drugs which can reduce sickle cell crisis by interfering and reducing the degree of hydrophobic bonding among sickle haemoglobin molecules. Research efforts are also in progress to test and determine the ant sickling potentials of a variety of local plant extracts and some of their derived compounds. Other areas of on-going research include the Biochemistry of the soil and locally significant micro-organisms, the effect of various pollutants and hydro carbon compounds on the environment and organisms, etc.</p>
<p>Also, our research and teaching staff on sabbatical recently participated in the discovery of an ultrasensitive method for the detection and diagnosis of Prion diseases such as Mad Cow Disease, Scrapie and CJD, published in a World Leading Research Journal, Nature Methods. &nbsp;At present in Nigeria, and much of Africa, Biochemistry is still in its infant stage of development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By anchoring itself in the development of its teaching and research staff, to be second to none in the country while it remains focused and committed in training students in the core subjects and skills in Biochemistry, the Department aims at contributing in the building of a National Labour Force that can add value that is significant to our present and future effort on industrialization which would pale all past national efforts into insignificance.</p>

Admission is either by Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) or by Direct-Entry. Students admitted by UTME undergo a four-year degree programme while those admitted by direct entry do a three-year degree programme.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The field of biology is one which has undergone a lot of evolution and continues to evolve every day, more so, since the early twentieth century. Early studies in Biology were devoted more to the study of life-cycles of organisms and similarities in their physical appearances. But with advancements in the field of genetics, aided mainly by studies of microorganisms, Microbiology emerged as one of the most important areas of study in the life sciences.</p>
<p>As the pioneer Department of Microbiology in the country, the Department of Microbiology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, is planned to be at the forefront of teaching and learning, research and development, knowledge creation and dissemination in the field of Microbiology, aimed at producing world class microbiologists.</p>
<p>Microbiology has taken a pivotal role in the study and advancement of life sciences, being the foundation on which Modern Biotechnology was built. It is therefore relevant in all fields of research and development for the improvement of human life. Its many applications have brought advancements, through Biotechnology, in such areas as Medical Diagnosis, Brewing, Agriculture, Industrial Production of food and pharmaceuticals, Environmental Monitoring, Bioremediation, Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and other emerging areas of Biotechnology. Hence, it is imperative that the student of Microbiology should be properly equipped to play the expected roles in these important areas of life.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The programme is designed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>To give students a sound exposure to the theory and practice of Microbiology.</li>
<li>To equip students with adequate research techniques to enable them function as lecturers in universities and other tertiary institutions, research officers and consultants in the many fields of application of Microbiology.</li>
<li>To equip students with adequate practical knowledge to enable them become self reliant as producers of many food and industrial products of microbial activity.</li>
<li>To produce world class microbiologists who can compete with their counterparts the world over and fit into advanced programmes within the country and outside it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The Department offers a very robust and forward-looking programme in the general and applied areas of Microbiology to prepare its graduates for their important role in the advancement of life. The core courses are designed to give students wide exposure in the main areas, which include Medical, Industrial/Food and Environmental Microbiology, including Climate Change studies. The students undergo industrial attachment during their third year of study, which affords them practical experience in diagnostic techniques and other microbiological processes in hospitals and industries.</p>
<p>The Department also offers, in conjunction with the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, B.Sc. combined degree in Microbiology/Chemistry and Microbiology/ Biochemistry.</p>
<p>In addition, service courses are offered to students in other areas of Biological Sciences, Medical Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Agricultural Sciences and Health and Physical Education.</p>
<p><strong>Job Opportunities</strong></p>

<p><strong>BOTANY</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The B.Sc. programme is designed to encourage and promote the training of students in all aspects of Botany. The Department is no longer called Botany, it has been modified to Plant Science and Biotechnology, so go ahead and read about Plant Science and Biotechnology in the next page. The students are expected, at the end of their programme to be aware of their environment and appreciate the delicate balance between plant life and the existence of the Earth. Above all, it is the core goal of the Department to produce graduates who can relate to the needs of the society through their knowledge of the amazing facets of plant life and plant products.</p>
<p>In line with the diversification of the University programmes of the Orthodox London and Cambridge University, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka&rsquo;s Department of Botany has sought out ways of training the students to fit into the demands of a developing country. More and more the old spirit of white-collar job is fast phasing out and Botany has to be made relevant to the needs of the individual in particular and the nation at large.</p>
<p>To this extent, the course system has been planned out to give the students the broad education which would enable them to see Botany in the wider contest of science education. It is not now based on cutting the plant and studying its anatomy or memorizing as many plant names as possible, but ensuring that the role of plants in the life of the individual and the nation&rsquo;s economy and existence is adequately emphasized.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Botany offers a 4-year programme by entrance and a 3-year programme by direct entry leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) Honours degrees with emphasis in Botany.</p>
<p>In addition to the University minimum entry requirements, both categories of students (entrance and direct) are expected to obtain credit in English, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics in the West African School Certificate Examination or G.C.E., O&rsquo; level or its equivalent. Direct entry students are also expected to obtain passes at principal level in the Higher School Certificate Examination or G.C.E. level or its equivalent in Chemistry and Biology or Botany or Zoology.</p>
<p>The programmes are designed to give an understanding of the basic principles of biological sciences and give depth in various aspects of Botany including Plant Anatomy, Plant Taxonomy, Biosystematics, Plant Morphology, Mycology, Plant Pathology, Plant Physiology, Plant Ecology, Cytology and Genetics. The Department also offers courses in Plant Micro-technique and Photography, Fungus Physiology, Plant Virology, Dendrology, Economic Botany, Plant Morphogenesis, Tree Growth, Fresh Water Algology, Bryology, Embryology of Angiosperms and Palynology.</p>
<p>Students majoring in Botany are required to take courses in Zoology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, English, Humanities and Social Sciences and may be required to take elective courses in Physics, Geology, Zoology, Microbiology, Crop Science, Soil Science, Mathematics and Statistics. In the final year, all Botany majors are required to undertake a special independent study involving experimental investigations of relevant botanical problems.</p>
<p>All students of Botany (Majors and Combined degree students) are expected to participate in regular field trips and occasional excursions.</p>
<p>The Department also offers service courses to students of Agriculture and other interested students of other Departments or Faculties. The Department of Botany in collaboration with other departments also offers B.Sc. Combined degree programmes in Botany/Zoology; Botany/Chemistry; Biology/Education, and Botany/Biochemistry.</p>
<p><strong>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
<p>The student of Botany had tended to feel that his/her professional destination was either a classroom or a research station. The present programme is, therefore, to equip the students for other jobs than those previously known for Botanists.</p>
<p>Students graduating from Department of Botany may choose careers in teaching and/or research in colleges, universities and research institutions, government, agriculture, forestry, conservation and wild-life management, wood technology.</p>

<p><strong><u>FACULTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>The training of a pharmacist requires the provision of broad-based education in the various aspects of the pharmaceutical sciences. &nbsp;However, the ultimate form of any professional education is one that produces practitioners with adequate knowledge, skills and motivation to provide important, needed and useful services. Ensuring high standards in pharmaceutical education embraces the philosophy that the educated person should have both general and specialized knowledge &ndash; general because without it one is too narrow a specialist, and specialized because it equips one with the faculty for accurate judgment in the practice of the profession. A qualified pharmacist is one who is trained and educated for a wide range of scientific, professional and managerial functions which best serve the pharmaceutical needs of the community and the nation. Such a pharmacist should possess sufficient adaptability to meet the demands of a rapidly changing health care delivery system.</p>
<p>With regard to educational outcomes and competencies, the revised B. Pharm. programme has been developed to focus on the new paradigm in pharmacy practice, which places emphasis on pharmaceutical care, mirrored in responsible patient care. On the completion of the academic training, the graduates are expected to exhibit professional competencies in all aspects of modern-day pharmacy practice. The pharmacist should, therefore, exhibit competencies and skills not only in pharmaceutical care but, also, in evidence-based clinical practice, policy issues, quality assurance in pharmaceutical services, pharmacovigilance, emerging disease patterns, pharmacoeconomic analyses, management of health care teams, use of information and communication technology, information management, interpersonal communications, medicinal products testing and quantification, adaptation approaches against the impact of climate change on medicinal plants and herbs, research and instruction. The product of this programme should be a truly seven-star pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the programme is to offer the student a broad-based education and hence produce a person not just specialized in pharmacy education but also having a general knowledge in most areas of the professional practice. With this as a basis, the undergraduate programme prepares the students for the various facets of the practice of pharmacy. This objective is hinged on a deep sense of, and respect for, human life.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The programme, which has been drawn up in line with PCN and NUC benchmark minimum standards, leads to the degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy. &nbsp;The courses are designed to give the students a good grounding in the main disciplines of Pharmacy including Pharmaceutics, Pharmaceutical Technology, Industrial Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmacognosy, Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Pharmacy Management, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hospital Pharmacy, Pharmacy Jurispr</p>

<p><strong>Surgical Separation of Siamese Twins</strong></p>
<p>No birth defects have stirred the minds of people with such intensity and amazement as the birth of conjoined twins (Siamese twins). Most conjoined twins are still born, products of miscarriages, or victims of traditional rituals. The apparent incidence is recorded as 1 per 50,000 to 60,000 births. As of date 400 conjoined twins have either still joined or surgically separated in the entire world. Within the period, 1987 to 1991, a team of surgeons, anaesthetists, and nurses at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital embarked on the surgical separation of 3 different sets of conjoined twins namely &ndash; Pygopagus (joined by the buttocks), Craniopagus (joined by the head) and Ischiopagus (joined by the pelvis).</p>
<p>The Pygopagus twins was amongst a set of female triplets born (16 November, 1987) by spontaneous vaginal delivery. This birth procedre is outrightly condemned as it is engraved with high mortality for both mother and offspring. Delivery of all conjoined twins must be made by planned elective Caesarian section. Pre-natal diagnosis must be made by means of ultrasound scan, Radiology and other available investigations. At the age of 51 days, the conjoined pair were surgically separated (on 8 January, 1988). The babies (all three) are now about 13 years. The surgical success stems from adequate pre-operative study of the union and shared organs; efficient operative and post-operative management.</p>
<p>The Craniopagus pair (born on 9 March 1989) were surgically separated and reconstructed on 6 June, 1989 but the babies died shortly after surgery. This was a total vertical Craniopagus with an extensive fronto-parieto-occipito-temporal union. They shared an abnormal circumferential and cerebral sinus for which the surgical world has not recorded a success.</p>
<p>The Ischiopagus conjoined twins (born on 28 January, 1990) lived together for about one year before surgery (on 7 January, 1991). One baby died 6 hours and the other 5 weeks after surgery. In addition to other organs, they shared a single liver, pericardium and abdominal aorta. The unavailability of parental nutrition reduced their chances of survival.</p>
