He received his early education at The King's School in that city. He took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. in 1583 and 1587 respectively from Cambridge University. He started writing poems and became a renowned dramatist in the Admiral's Company.  Marlowe is known as one of the university wits, a group of dramatists along with Robert Greene, Thomas Nash, and George Peele. Marlowe is considered the greatest precursor to Shakespeare. When Marlowe came upon the English stage, the nature of drama was undeveloped. The verses in the dramas were lifeless. But Marlowe gave English drama an appropriate meter, diction, and method. It is really a matter of speculation what kind of greatness he would have achieved if his life had not been terminated (C++) in a duel after a brawl in a tavern (inn).  The literary life of Marlowe had a short span, from 1587 to 1593. During this period, he wrote five plays which were all tragedies as he had no comic vein. His tragedies like Dr Faustus, The Jew of Malta, and Edward Il are rated as some of the best works of the Elizabethan age. He also wrote an unfinished poem Hero and Leander and translated some parts of Ovid's (a Roman Poet) elegies.  Marlowe's subjects are mostly heroic which appeals to the imagination of the play-goers. His heroes epitomize the spirit of the Renaissance. Each of them embodies a passion and tries to achieve lies in his development of the blank verse. He put it at any cost. But Marlowe's chief contribution aside from the old rhyming lines then employed in the plays and used blank verse. Thus, the language of drama was brought closer to real life and drama was made ready for Shakespeare (1564-1616) to improve upon it. It is rightly said, \"No Marlowe, no Shakespeare\".",

But your body, a living machine, has a definite limitation - its work continues, it gradually loses its responsiveness, becomes less irritable, turns out less work and finally may not respond at all. The feeling of fatigue usually expresses itself in three ways: first, there is a feeling of tiredness and a marked desire for rest. Second, efficiency is greatly reduced.

WHO (World Health Organisation) declares that it is an accomplice in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths each year. Malnutrition covers a wide range of illness from undernourishment due to a lack of one or more nutrients such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies to obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases. However, Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is by far the lethal form of malnutrition. Malnutrition is not restricted to children. It casts long shadows in the developing world according to WHO. Industrialized countries are not free from the scourge of malnutrition as about 11 million people suffer from it. Malnutrition is caused by a deficiency in the intake of nutrients by the cells of the body and it is usually triggered by a combination of factors, an insufficient intake of proteins, calories, vitamins and minerals and frequent infections. Illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, malaria, and respiratory diseases that the body heavily and cause loss of nutrients. They reduce appetite and food intake thus contributing to malnutrition. Children are at a greater risk of suffering malnutrition. This is because they are in a period of rapid growth that increases the demand for calories and proteins. For Similar reasons pregnant and nursing women are easily prone to malnutrition. Frequently the baby&rsquo;s problem begins even before birth. If a mother is undernourished or malnourished before and during pregnancy, the baby will have low weight. Then early weaning, poor feeding habits and lack of hygiene can bring malnutrition. Malnutrition wreaks havoc on the body particularly that of a child and various studies have shown that poor growth in the child is associated with impaired mental development and poor scholastic and intellectual performance. A report from united state calls these effects the most serious long term results of malnutrition. For children who survived malnutrition the aftermath can linger on into adulthood.

      "question": "<p>Malnutrition has been described as a tragedy of great magnitude. WHO (World Health Organisation) declares that it is an accomplice in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths each year. Malnutrition covers a wide range of illness from undernourishment due to a lack of one or more nutrients such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies to obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases. However, Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is by far the lethal form of malnutrition. Malnutrition is not restricted to children. It casts long shadows in the developing world according to WHO. Industrialized countries are not free from the scourge of malnutrition as about 11 million people suffer from it. Malnutrition is caused by a deficiency in the&nbsp;intake of nutrients by the cells of the body and it is usually triggered by a combination of factors, an insufficient intake of proteins, calories, vitamins and minerals and frequent infections. Illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, malaria, and respiratory diseases that the body heavily and cause loss of nutrients. They reduce appetite and food intake thus contributing to malnutrition. Children are at a greater risk of suffering malnutrition. This is because they are in a period of rapid growth that increases the demand for calories and proteins. For Similar reasons pregnant and nursing women are easily prone to malnutrition. Frequently the baby&rsquo;s problem begins even before birth. If a mother is undernourished or malnourished before and during pregnancy, the baby will have low weight. Then early weaning, poor feeding habits and lack of hygiene can bring malnutrition. Malnutrition wreaks havoc on the body particularly that of a child and various studies have shown that poor growth in the child is associated with impaired mental development and poor scholastic and intellectual performance. A report from united state calls these effects the most serious long term results of malnutrition. For children who survived malnutrition the aftermath can linger on into adulthood. Why is malnutrition described as a tragedy of great magnitude?</p>",

Today, the world is witnessing political and social changes arising from the desire of people all over the globe for greater freedom and a voice in the way they are governed and a better standard of living. Pan of these struggles and processes have become more pronounced in the Third World since the end of the East-West cold War in the late 1980's, and in the face of the challenges being posed by the ongoing process of globalization. While political and social changes may appear to be distinct phenomena, they are analytically inseparable. Political and social changes refer to alteration or transformations in human behavior, norms and politico-social institutions. Such changes are often a collective response to the need to change, or as a tacit recognition of a shift in the prevalent power relations in the society. Therefore, the coming to power of a new set of rulers, or the establishment of new structure and processes of governance broadly typifies socio-political changes. It is important to note that changes can either be positive or negative. In most cases, political and social changes are caused by certain factors or reasons. This push people to collectively organize themselves to struggle for a change in the existing power relations.

Good music provides entertainment and emotional release, and it accompanies activities ranging from dances to religious ceremonies. Music is heard everywhere; in auditoriums, homes, elevators, schools, sports arenas and on the streets. Recorded performance is a sensational innovation elevation of the twentieth century. Thanks to modern technology like compact disc (CD) digital video disc (DVD) and the MP 3 player, music can now be heard in divers places. Such places include living rooms and cars, jogging paths can also function as new kinds of concert halls where we can hear what we want as often as we want. Live performances provide a special excitement. In a live performance artistes put themselves on the line. To avoid embarrassment, the artiste must train before hand and ensure that technical difficulties are avoided and that the listeners are actively involved. What is performed, how it sounds to the excitement of such a moment and feelings are exchanged between stage and hall. Our response to a musical performance or an artiste is subjective and rooted in deep feelings. Even professional critics can differ strongly in their evaluations of a performance. There is no one ''Truth'' about what we hear and feel. Does the performed project a concept, an overall idea, or an emotion? Do some sections of a piece, but not others, communicate something to you? Can you figure out why? It is up to us as listeners to evaluate performances of music so that we can fully enjoy it. People listen to music in many different ways. For instance, music can be a barely perceived background as in a film or a totally absorbing experience as in a concert.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">Adapted from Roger, K.

The centre was intended to serve the whole of the defunct Northern Region, and there were several reasons for choosing Abuja . The first was the excellence of the traditional pottery made in the Emirate. Secondly, firewood is plentiful; this is a most important consideration, because in the making of glazed pottery, more firewood than clay is required. Thirdly, there are good clays, and good local sources for the raw materials needed for the glazes. Fourthly, water, which is another important raw material, is plentiful. Finally, Abuja is in a central position for the whole region and is a town where learners from many different parts can find a congenial temporary home, and where the Emir and his Council are actively interested in the project. Nearly all the making is done by a process called throwing;, so called because the lumps of clay are thrown the potter onto a wheel-head. They are weigh out so that each pot will be roughly the same size; for example, for making pint-sized jugs, the lumps of clay will be one and a half kilogrammes. The potter sits on the saddle of the wheel and spins it by pushing a pedal with his left foot. He has a bowl of water, a loofah, a bamboo knife, a pointed stick or porcupine quill, a wooden-smoothing tool which potters call a rib, and a piece of wire-like object that is used for wedging. He makes the wheel-heal slightly damp, and throws the lumps into the middle. The first work is to force the lump to the centre, then he presses his thumb into the middle of the lump, using water to keep it slippery. When the bottom is of the right thickness, he begins to draw up the walls until they are of the right height. Then he shapes the belly and shoulder of the pot. He trims off any waste clay.

Finally, Abuja is in a central position for the whole region and is a town where learners from many different parts can find a congenial temporary home, and where the Emir and his Council are actively interested in the project. Nearly all the making is done by a process called throwing;, so called because the lumps of clay are thrown the potter onto a wheel-head. They are weigh out so that each pot will be roughly the same size; for example, for making pint-sized jugs, the lumps of clay will be one and a half kilogrammes. The potter sits on the saddle of the wheel and spins it by pushing a pedal with his left foot. He has a bowl of water, a loofah, a bamboo knife, a pointed stick or porcupine quill, a wooden-smoothing tool which potters call a rib, and a piece of wire-like object that is used for wedging. He makes the wheel-heal slightly damp, and throws the lumps into the middle. The first work is to force the lump to the centre, then he presses his thumb into the middle of the lump, using water to keep it slippery. When the bottom is of the right thickness, he begins to draw up the walls until they are of the right height. Then he shapes the belly and shoulder of the pot. He trims off any waste clay. In this way, a small and medium-sized pot can be made quickly and accurately.

In other words, Nigerian people are very religious most of them believe that there is an unseen supernatural world, apart from the natural world we see around us. This other world is inhabited by beings who are the source of our knowledge of good and evil. They watch and judge us, and if we offend them they may have to be appeased with prayers and sacrifices. Certain individuals in the natural in the natural world-priests, prophets and diviners- are believed to be endowed with special powers to make contact with the other world. These individuals lay down ceremonies or rituals which must be observed if due honour is to be paid to the unseen beings. The religious belief and practices of Nigerians can be classified under three main headings: Traditional religion, Islam and Christianity. In this passage, our focus is on traditional religion. Traditional or indigenous religion continues to exert a strong influence on many people's mind partly because of its association with their birth places and families. Each ethnic group has its own religious traditional and these are often linked to some sacred spots in the ethnic homeland. Yet the various traditional religions have much in common: a remote but benevolent high god; under him, a number of lesser gods who interact with mankind; and below them various spirits who inhabit natural objects (trees, streams, rock, etc); below them again, and closest to living men and women, the spirits of the ancestors. In the Yoruba tradition, for example, there are more than 400 lesser deities presided over by the high god, olorun. Because he is remote from mankind, shrines are not built to him and worship is not offered to him directly. The lesser gods, on the other hand, are the subject of special cults, each with its own priests and devotees. Eshu, the messenger of the gods; lfa, the god of divination; Shango, the god of thunder, and so on. Traditional religion was also strong in other parts of Nigeria. In lgbo Traditional religion, there were fewer gods. Although there was a remote high god, the most important figure was Ala or Ani, the goddess of the earth. In Hausaland, traditional religion has largely gone underground owing to the influence of lslam, but belief in the existence of 'Bori' spirits and their power to possess people, especially woman, is strong in some areas. Each spirit is associated with certain type of behaviou, which is manifested by the possessed individual Divination - the discovery of what is unknown or is yet to happen by supernatural or magical means - is an important element of traditional religion. It is often one of the functions of medicine - men or herbalists. In lgboland, there also used to be several oracles which people consulted in order to seek solutions to their problems. With the coming of Christianity, their influence has however waned, but in areas like Arochukwu and Okija, the influence of such oracles is still strongly felt.&nbsp;</span></p>",

T learn by experience is to learn from mistakes. It means you have burnt our fingers and now your eyes are open'. This is a tough, costly and inconvenient way to learn. Rather than leaving our learning to experience, why do we not learn consciously going out way to acquire knowledge and wisdom rather than leave our learning to chance. Surely, we can learn from mistakes but why wait till when we make mistakes before we lean? We should give more premium to learning by wisdom than by experience. This will involve one making up ones mind to be decisive in learning. We must decide to learn consciously and not necessarily from negative experiences. The first step is to realize that life is simply the outcome and outplay of decisions. Our life now is the sum total of our decisions and our future will be determined by our decisions. Our life now is the sum total of our decisions and our future will be determined by our decisions of today. If we decide to learn today we are not likely to make mistakes and when we do not make mistakes, experience need not be our best teacher.&nbsp; To avoid making experience our best teacher will take more than a decision. We must couple our decision with a complete and -wholehearted devotion. We must be resolved, resolute and resilient in our bid to learn by wisdom and not necessarily by experience. This is crucial because situations and circumstances will want us to make a detour and leave our learning and life to chance. We must therefore be disciplined to remain with our resolve to make a clean break with experience as our best teacher. Disciplined in this regard means learning something new everyday by wisdom rather than rather than experience. It means consciously getting better by the day in your chosen field. Discipline will demand taking advantage of every learning opportunity that comes our way. It will mean we must pay the price for learning by wisdom -invest in books, magazines, seminars and other means by which we may become wiser. It is much easier and cheaper to learn consciously by wisdom than to learn by experience. When we learn by experience , the deed is done and we are just picking up the pieces-learning in regret how to avoid such predicament next time. Consider the child who grapes a burning coal, he has learned the hard way through the painful experience, but his fingers will remain burnt.

Even though communication was being accomplished in space at a range of more than a million times this distance, the new radio station caused must excitement among scientists. The reason: its power supply was &lsquo;battery &lsquo;made of bacteria. For the first time, practical amounts of electricity were being produced by a form of life and put to use. &lsquo;biocell&rsquo;, the new power supply had a liquid fuel containing tiny forms of life that changed the fuel directly into electric energy. This was far more than an interesting experiment. The biocell is being developed as producer of electricity for radios, for signals to guide ships, for lighting and for other uses. Thought the working biocell is only a few years old, some scientists feel that it will one day produce power cheaply as is now being done by other methods, and that the biocell will use materials that would otherwise be considered a waste. Early biocells were powered with sugar, but a wide range of fuels can be used. Work is being done using sea water to feed the bacteria. Electricity from living cells is no new idea. Man experienced the strange &lsquo;shock &lsquo;produced by some fish even before electricity was really discovered. Then in time, there were other discoveries.

If you own a car, you realize that you must put oil and gas into it and must put water in the radiator and take care of the car as a whole. You begin to develop quite a little thermodynamic sense. You know that you are either going to have to keep the machine in a good order or it is going to be in trouble and fail to function. We have not been seeing our spaceship earth as an integrally-designed machine which to be persistently successful, must be comprehended and serviced in total. Now there is one outstanding important fact regarding Spaceship Earth and that is that no instrument book came with it. I think it is very significant that there is no instrument book for successfully operating our ship, in view of the infinite attention to all other details displayed by our ship. It must be taken as deliberate and purposeful that an instruction book was omitted. Lack of instruction has forced us to find out that there are two kinds of mangoes-unripe mangoes that will kill us and ripped mangoes which will nourish us. And we had to find out ways of telling which were-which mangoes before we ate it or otherwise we would die. So we were forced because of this to devise scientific experimental procedures and to interpret effectively the significance of the experimental findings. Thus, because the instruction manual was missing, we are learning how we can safely survive on the planet. Quite clearly, all living beings are utterly helpless at the moment of birth. The human child stays helpless longer than the young of any species. Apparently, it is part of the &ldquo;invention&rdquo; that man is meant to be utterly helpless through certain anthropological phases. When he begins to be able to get on a little better, he is meant to discover some of the physical principals inherent in the universe as well as the many resources around him which will further multiply his knowledge. Designed into this Spaceship Earth&rsquo;s total wealth was a big safety factor.

It is what our bodies are trying to do when we pace around or tap our legs and fingers. It is much better to channel it into a more complete form of exercise like a brisk walk, a run, a bike ride, or a game of squash. Just as we are all capable of mounting up and sustaining a stress reaction, we have also inherited the ability to put our bodies into a state of deep relaxation called the &lsquo;relaxation response&rsquo;.

It is also the problem that every doctor shares with patients. Experts note that stress is an issue everyone can relate to experimentally. In studying and better understanding about stress, we can derive personal as well as professional benefits. Stress can be overcome without undergoing duress. They often say anyone who wants to help someone deal with his/her stress should learn to handle his/her first. The manifestation of stress is legion. It can contribute or mimic just about any symptom you can think of. However, the main symptoms are physical, mental, emotional and behavioural. The cause of stress are multiple and varied but they can be classified into external and internal. External stressors can include relatively getting sick or dying, jobs being lost or people criticizing or one becoming angry. However, most of the stress people experience is self-generated. Experts tell us that we create the majority of our upsets indicating that because we cause most of our own stress, we can do something about it. This gives us a measure of choice and control that we do not always have when outside forces act on us. This also leads to a basic premise about stress reduction. To master stress-change, you have to figure out what you are doing that is contributing to your problems and change it. These changes fall into behaviour, thinking, lifestyle choices and/ or situations you are in. by getting to the root causes of your stress, you can prevent recurrences. As a way of draining off stress energy, nothing beats aerobic exercise. To understand why, we need to review what stress is. People often think of stress as pressure at work, a demanding boss, a sick child or rush-hour traffic. These may be trigger but stress is actually the body reaction to factors such as these. Stress is the fight-or-fight response in the body, mediated by adrenaline and other stress hormones and comprised such physiologic changes as increased heart rate and blood pressure, faster breathing, muscle tension, dilated pupils, dry mouth and increased blood sugar. In other words, stress is the state of increased arousal necessary for an organism to defend itself at a time of danger. Exercise is the most logical way to dissipate the excess energy. It is what our bodies are trying to do when we pace around or tap our legs and fingers. It is much better to channel it into a more complete form of exercise like a brisk walk, a run, a bike ride, or a game of squash. Just as we are all capable of mounting up and sustaining a stress reaction, we have also inherited the ability to put our bodies into a state of deep relaxation called the &lsquo;relaxation response&rsquo;.

These are population explosion and debilitating mass poverty. Population explosion in the country has greatly increased the need for more schools so much that demand now far outstrips provision of education opportunities, particularly at the post-secondary level. In addition, the Nigerian society is currently handicapped by a crippling economic crisis which has forced many people out of school as a result of growing inability to meet the cost of training, like tuition fees and board charges. A way out of these problems lies in the provision of educational opportunities through the use of radio and television broadcast. Only when radio and television are fully utilized for teaching and learning can the foundation be laid for mass education in the country. Besides, using radio and television to transmit educational programmes can cut the cost of education as boarding and tuition will become unnecessary for most beneficiaries. At the moment, many Nigerians are unable to enrol to stay on in school because of the high cost of education and because government is unable to provide the staggering amount needed to finance mass education via the traditional school system . Also of importance is the fact that radio and television will offer good opportunities for the standardization of education in the country. At the moment, the best school in terms of facilities and qualified teachers are concentrated in the urban centres to the detriment of the rural areas. This has given rise to imbalance and uneven distribution of qualitative education in the country, so much so that experienced and qualified teachers often reject posting to rural schools, while over-concentration leads to under-utilization of capable hands in urban schools. Since educational broadcasting involves the best brains producing and broadcasting educational materials from one central location and reaching out simultaneously to scattered audience in the rural and urban areas, the quality of educational provision will be made even throughout the country. The usual argument against the use of radio and television for teaching is the absence of immediate feedback which is thought to be essential for learning. But this handicap is more than compensated for by the listener&rsquo;s or watcher&rsquo;s ability to record and play back as often as he or she likes, any part of the lesson he or she may find confusing or difficult to understand. Besides, support facilities like telephone and postal services may be used to clarify difficulties or answer students&rsquo; questions.

Naturally, Nigerian pidgin appears to be the first choice of most Nigerians in informal situations, especially when they are among those from different ethnic and linguistic background. Thus, the selection process has tactically taken place. Among all the languages used in Nigeria today, English inclusive, Nigerian pidgin could be said to be the most widely spoken. Evidence abounds in motor parks, parties, congregations and most social occasions. There is also ample evidence in the electronic and print media, especially in political propaganda, campaigns and product advertisement. Thus, in terms of spread and extensive use, Nigerian pidgin could rightly be called a national lingua franca. The use of Nigerian pidgin in contemporary Nigerian could be described as most productive, extensive and complex. It appears that the standardization processes-selection, codification, elaboration of functions and acceptance-which started in the post-colonial era, are as now being completed in contemporary Nigeria. The reason for this assumption is simple-apart from its complex use as a lingua franca, languages of media advertisement, social interaction, unofficial military training and limited literary output, Nigerian pidgin gas attained widespread acceptability in the media, political propaganda and campaigns as well as soap operas. It is also the language of radio and television jingles. Most electronic media now use appreciable percentage of their airtime to cast news and give reports in Nigeria pidgin. Even though its use in some newspaper columns has declined, especially with the demise of the &lsquo;Waka About&rsquo; column in the Daily Times, it is however found extensively in some newspaper advertisements . In places like Warri, Sapele and Port Harcourt, there were reports that teachers at lower primary level taught their pupils in Nigerian pidgin. This unofficial adoption of the Nigerian pidgin as the language of the lower primary education by those teachers is justifiable considering the provision in the National Policy on Education, which states that in addition to English, the major language in the child&rsquo;s environment could be used at the elementary level of education. Similarly, Nigerian pidgin has become a language of religious preaching, especially Christianity.

Conditions as different as diabetes, heart diseases, and extreme obesity, as well as other health problems have been linked to it. Yet, most victims are oblivious of this debt. The debtor is the one who does not have enough sleep needed for well-being. This can be caused by voluntary sleep deprivation resulting from a person&rsquo;s life-style or by involuntary sleep deprivation because of illness and other causes. Medical researchers estimate that the earth&rsquo;s population is now getting on the average an hour less sleep per into both the variety of sleep-related illnesses and their impact on the quality of life. &nbsp;The; medical world once viewed the chronic inability to sleep as just one disorder, commonly called insomnia. However, a commission created by the U.S. Congress recognized 17 distinct sleep disorders. At any rate, insomnia has so many causes that it is often considered to be a sympt5om of other problems, much as fever suggests some sort of infection. Even occasional deprivation of sleep can be disastrous. Consider the case of Tom, although an experienced truck driver, he plunged his 18-wheel vehicle over an embankment, spilling 400 litres of sulphuric acid onto a major highway. Tom admits: &lsquo;fell asleep.&rsquo; Students of two U.S. highways estimated that drowsy drivers caused some 50 per cent of the fatal crashes.

What factors may contribute to lack of sleep? &lsquo;One is the social phenomenon often called 24/7- operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The newspaper, USA Today, described this as a cultural earthquake that is changing the way we live, noting that a new wave of round-the-clock retailers and services is profiting by mocking the clock. In many lands, people watch all-night television programmes and access the internet when they should be sleeping. Then there is the toll taken by emotional disorders, often involving anxieties heightened by stress occasioned by the pace of life. Also, there are a variety of physical diseases that can contribute to lack of sleep. Many doctors note how difficult it is to get their patients to take sleep seriously. One doctor complained that chronic fatigue is even considered &lsquo;a status symbol&rsquo; by some. And because their condition often worsens very gradually, victims of sleep deprivation may not recognize that they suffer from a serious sleep disorder. Many of them reason, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just getting old&rsquo; or I&rsquo; can&rsquo;t cope with life, so I tend to shut down&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired all the time because I can never get the long rest I need.&rsquo; Reversing this sleep debt is a complex challenge. But understanding how a healthful sleep cycle works and learning to identify the signs of sleep debt can provide the motivation to change. Recognizing the symptoms of a serious sleep disorder can save lives and this should be a warning to many Nigerians, particularly those who engage in long night journeys.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">&nbsp;</p>",

      "question": "<p>In time past in Nigeria, being a secretary was perceived with utter disdain by many people. Other professionals such as teachers, lawyers, engineers, surveyors, estate officers and architects were revered. Many issues readily come to mind concerning the old perspective of secretaries as professionals. One, they were regarded as people with little or no education. Indeed, many of them were said to be mere typists who learnt how to punch keys on the typewriter. They hardly had any formal education but obtained doubtful certificates. This was made possible because anyone could easily learn to be a typist under the shade of a tree or in a personal office of a retired secretary or a chief typist from any business organization. As long as a short piece of work could be typed almost accurately and in record time, one then became a secretary. This unrealistic practice &ndash; to call an unqualified person a secretary &ndash; might have been introduced and sustained by people who did not know who a secretary was. The educated secretaries obtained a minimum of the Ordinary National Diploma (OND) or its equivalent from institutions in and outside Nigeria, particularly Great Britain, Canada or the United States of America. Two, they were mostly women and very few male secretaries, who suffered more humiliation than their female counterparts. They were regarded as men who did not succeed in life and did the work that normally women were supposed to do. Three, and deriving from the second reason, secretaries were, as a matter of fact, very close to their bosses. Most people, including husbands of secretaries, regarded such a mode of interaction as tempting &ndash; a kind of constant closeness which might engender a deliberation or unintentional amorous relationship between superior and subordinate officer. Quite often, such a situation could not be ruled out when body contacts was established inadvertently or deliberately between two people of opposite sex especially when either one or both people were attractive and attracted to each other. Moreover, we often talk of the devil and the havoc he is capable of causing in the lives of people, particularly the unguarded ones. In today&rsquo;s world, these points of view concerning secretaries are fading fast. Now, there is a clear distinction between a typist and a secretary. Modern secretaries are trained in polytechnics and universities. Gone are the days when secretaries were taught only the art of punching the typewriters and various filling systems. They are also encouraged to take training courses other than secretarial duty. Many secretaries have had their training in faculties of business administration, law, art and mass communications of universities.

Many issues readily come to mind concerning the old&nbsp;perspective of secretaries as professionals. One, they were regarded as people with little or no education. Indeed, many of them were said to be mere typists who learnt how to punch keys on the typewriter. They hardly had any formal education but obtained doubtful certificates. This was made possible because anyone could easily learn to be a typist under the shade of a tree or in a personal office of a retired secretary or a chief typist from any business organization. As long as a short piece of work could be typed almost accurately and in record time, one then became a secretary. This unrealistic practice &ndash; to call an unqualified person a secretary &ndash; might have been introduced and sustained by people who did not know who a secretary was. The educated secretaries obtained a minimum of the Ordinary National Diploma (OND) or its equivalent from institutions in and outside Nigeria, particularly Great Britain, Canada or the United States of America. Two, they were mostly women and very few male secretaries, who suffered more humiliation than their female counterparts. They were regarded as men who did not succeed in life and did the work that normally women were supposed to do. Three, and deriving from the second reason, secretaries were, as a matter of fact, very close to their bosses. Most people, including husbands of secretaries, regarded such a mode of interaction as&nbsp;tempting &ndash; a kind of constant closeness which might engender a deliberation or unintentional amorous relationship between superior and subordinate officer. Quite often, such a situation could not be ruled out when body contacts was established inadvertently or deliberately between two people of opposite sex especially when either one or both people were attractive and attracted to each other. Moreover, we often talk of the devil and the havoc he is capable of causing in the lives of people, particularly the unguarded ones. In today&rsquo;s world, these points of view concerning secretaries are fading fast. Now, there is a clear distinction between a typist and a secretary. Modern secretaries are trained in polytechnics and universities. Gone are the days when secretaries were taught only the art of punching the typewriters and various filling systems. They are also encouraged to take training courses other than secretarial duty. Many secretaries have had their training in faculties of business administration, law, art and mass communications of universities. They take relevant courses in administration and other social science departments that enhance their personality, carriage, interpersonal relations and office management.

      "question": "<p>While trying desperately to cope with the scourge of the dreaded HIV/AIDS virus, the human race was once again beset with the problem of grappling with fast-spreading and lethal pandemic called bird flu. Also called avian influenza, bird flu&rsquo;s vicious strain, H5NI, was spread from birds to humans and could be as deadly as HIV/AIDS. The pandemic had ravaged many countries in Europe, Asia and Middle East resulting in a high death toll in livestock, but as yet with a few human casualties. As the pandemic made its steady spread, there was the fear that if it ever gets to Africa, the consequences would be devastating in view of the continent&rsquo;s lack of infrastructure and money to keep it in control. This fear was consequent upon African&nbsp;countries&rsquo;&rsquo; unenviable response to emergencies in the past, like drought in some sahelian countries or flooding along the coast. It was against this frightening background that many Nigerians were thrown into panic following the announcement on Wednesday the 8th of February, 2006, that the bird flu had indeed entered Nigeria. The announcement itself was a sequel to the death of a large number of birds in a farm in Kaduna State whose samples were diagnosed at the National Veterinary Institute, Vom, Plateau State, and confirmed at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Diagnostic Centre in Rome, Italy. Several follow-up actions had been taking to try and halt the spread of the virus in the country, such as the immediate quarantine of the affected farms, the killing and disposal of all infested and surviving birds in affected farms and the restriction of movement of people in and outside such farms. Commendable as these measures were, many Nigerians still dreaded the chicken and had already excluded its meat from their menu. As a result, poultry farmers in Nigeria were counting their losses instead of producing more protein and smiling to the bank with good sales. to return to the status quo ante and restore the confidence of Nigerians in poultry products, additional measures were suggested, namely the close monitoring of migratory birds which flock into the country at different times of the year, the proper caging of all free-range birds and appropriate sanctioning of defaulting owners, not restricting the monitoring of poultry farms in the country to the urban centres only, the upward review of the compensation paid to farmers whose birds had been destroyed to cushion the effects of their loss, the strict enforcement of the restriction on the importation of poultry products and , lastly the leadership demonstrating, by example, that it was safe to eat poultry products by serving them at dinners and banquets during state functions.

First, there is the paper which set out to give a brief resume of the news and backs this up by well-written articles on the current affairs by leading writers and experts. Secondly, there is the &lsquo;daily&rsquo; which caters for popular taste, and contains only the most sensational and exciting bits of news, supporting them with comic-strips, pictures children&rsquo;s corners, women&rsquo;s sections and readers&rsquo; letters on anything but weighty topics. Thirdly, there is the propaganda type of paper, which presents only those versions of the news which agree with its own particular political outlook. All this gives news in different ways; but what deeper function can the ideal daily paper have? In the case of the Nigerian daily newspaper, the first type gives the thinking reader an unbiased view of the world situation, so that he can judge the importance of recent events for himself, but it does not indicate to him what he ought to think. The drawbacks to this is that semi-literate or uneducated find it dull or difficult and so are discouraged from reading such a paper regularly, because it demands too much thought and effort from them. The main advantage of this type of paper, however, is its soundness, excellent English expression and general effect of widening the readers&rsquo; knowledge on a variety of subjects. The second type interest the majority and give them more striking items of news in an easily comprehensible way, accompanied by lavish photographs and usually with some slight political bias towards the left and the interests of the working class, from which most of its readers come. The drawback of this type is that there is not enough solid thinking mater and the English is often faulty in style &ndash; tending towards &lsquo;journalese&rsquo;. The advantage is that it is quickly and easily read, on the bus or train or over the breakfast table, and gives a superficial knowledge of current affairs to people who would not have the time or inclination to read &lsquo;heavier&rsquo; literature. Also, it is a &lsquo;family&rsquo; paper, which every member of the household can enjoy, since there is something to please all their tastes. The third type to some extent, appeals to emotion, not reason. It instruct the reader in exactly what that particular editor believe he ought to think, and does not give him a chance to have a mind of his own by letting him hear the other person&rsquo;s point of view. The drawback is that it prevents people from thinking for themselves, and causes political hysteria rather than logical thinking. the only advantage is that it does represent the &lsquo;freedom of the press&rsquo; to publish whatever it likes, and allows discontented people to air their grievances instead of letting them smoulder underground. From these examples, it should be clear that the ideal function of a daily paper would be to present the news clearly and simply, and to support it with articles in good English which shows the points of view of various competent people of different outlooks on current problems. The reader could then choose which line of thought appealed to him most. Women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s sections would be good so long as they did not grow so out of proportion that the paper depended solely upon them for its popularity. Good pictures would add to the paper&rsquo;s instructive value as well as to its interest; and advertisements, kept in bounds, might be helpful, both as shopping guides and as a financial help to the paper itself.

From these examples, it should be clear that the ideal function of a daily paper would be to present the news clearly and simply, and to support it with articles in good English which shows the points of view of various competent people of different outlooks on current problems.

First, there is the paper which set out to give a brief resume of the news and backs this up by well-written articles on the current affairs by leading writers and experts. Secondly, there is the &lsquo;daily&rsquo; which caters for popular taste, and contains only the most sensational and exciting bits of news, supporting them with comic-strips, pictures children&rsquo;s corners, women&rsquo;s sections and readers&rsquo; letters on anything but weighty topics. Thirdly, there is the propaganda type of paper, which presents only those versions of the news which agree with its own particular political outlook. All this gives news in different ways; but what deeper function can the ideal daily paper have? In the case of the Nigerian daily newspaper, the first type gives the thinking reader an unbiased view of the world situation, so that he can judge the importance of recent events for himself, but it does not indicate to him what he ought to think. The drawbacks to this is that semi-literate or uneducated find it dull or difficult and so are discouraged from reading such a paper regularly, because it demands too much thought and effort from them. The main advantage of this type of paper, however, is its soundness, excellent English expression and general effect of widening the readers&rsquo; knowledge on a variety of subjects. The second type interest the majority and give them more striking items of news in an easily comprehensible way, accompanied by lavish photographs and usually with some slight political bias towards the left and the interests of the working class, from which most of its readers come. The drawback of this type is that there is not enough solid thinking mater and the English is often faulty in style &ndash; tending towards &lsquo;journalese&rsquo;. The advantage is that it is quickly and easily read, on the bus or train or over the breakfast table, and gives a superficial knowledge of current affairs to people who would not have the time or inclination to read &lsquo;heavier&rsquo; literature.

No longer content with their traditional role as housewives and mothers, the women have joined together to create a kind of&nbsp;women liberation movement, first under the umbrella of WRAPA, an acronym for Women&rsquo;s Rights and Privileges Agency, and later under several bodies including non-governmental agencies like Women in Nigeria (WIN), Association of Northern Women in Science and Technology (ANWIST) and Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

No longer content with their traditional role as housewives and mothers, the women have joined together to create a kind of women liberation movement, first under the umbrella of WRAPA, an acronym for Women&rsquo;s Rights and Privileges Agency, and later under several bodies including non-governmental agencies like Women in Nigeria (WIN), Association of Northern Women in Science and Technology (ANWIST) and Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). A whole federal ministry called Ministry for Women Affairs has been established since 1995 for the development and advancement of Nigerian women towards what they call &lsquo;gender equality&rsquo;.&nbsp;Through all these bodies, Nigerian women hope to acquire the freedom to pursue interest outside the home, like the opportunity to acquire education or pursue a career, instead of spending all the time doing housework. The effects of the changes brought about by these bodies are already being felt in some families. For instance, the traditional husband-wife relationship appears to be undergoing a radical transformation. Because so man6yy women are now working, men are learning to share the household tasks of cooking, cleaning and even caring for the children. In some families, there appears to be a complete reversal of the traditional roles: the husband stays home while the wife earns the family&rsquo;s income. It should be pointed out, however, that this is the exception, not the rule. The effects of women&rsquo;s liberation are being felt not only in the home but also on the job. More and more women are working and they are demanding equal responsible positions. It is not uncommon these days for a woman to head major Government ministries and parastatals. Many businesses now encourage women to advance to high management positions, and every year, the nation&rsquo;s higher institutions produce more women doctors, lawyers, and accountants. Politics and government are other areas that are feeling the impact of women&rsquo;s movement. Although Nigerians do not appear ready to accept a woman president, women are already being elected to public offices in increasing numbers as senators and members of the national and state assemblies. Although Nigeria is yet to have a woman governor, which is the highest office in a state, there have been a few women deputy governors and house speakers. A few years ago, this would have been unthinkable. In conclusion, women in Nigeria are acquiring greater independence which is causing sweeping changes in the society &ndash; at home, at work and in politics. Some men may not be happy with these changes but the women are always quick to point out that it was they, the men, who created the condition leading to the reaction of the women.

Though a great number of Nigerians still live in the villages and small towns, work opportunities exist mainly in the big cities where development efforts are concentrated. The reason usually given for his obvious lapse is that it is easier to establish industries and to find finance and markets to keep them going in the big cities and towns than in the rural areas where productivity is low because of mass illiteracy and poverty. As capital is the product of human work, rural&nbsp;dwellers who are desperate enough to overcome poverty often leave the villages in search of some kind of existence in the big cities and towns. Therefore, rural unemployment in Nigeria produces mass migration into the cities, leading to a rate of urban growth which seriously taxes the resources of even the biggest cities like Ibadan, Lagos, Abuja and Kano. Form the sad experience of these cities; it is easy to see how rural unemployment can become urban unemployment with the attendant social problems like robbery, overcrowding and the growth of shanties or slums. Such problems cannot be wished away but will remain with us until deliberate efforts are made to bring health to economic life outside the big cities in order to check the migration of destitute rural dwellers into town and cities that cannot absorb them. It is necessary; therefore, that at least an important part of the development effort should bypass the bid cities and be concerned with the provision of viable infrastructure in the small town s and villages. In this connection, it is necessary to emphasize that the primary need is workplaces. The task should be to bring into existence thousands or millions of new workplaces in the rural areas and small towns in order to maximize work opportunities for rural dwellers.&nbsp;For this proposition to make sense, first, the work opportunities should be created in the rural areas where the majority of the people live, not where they tend to migrate for lack of opportunities. Second, the production method employed must be relatively simple, so that the demands for high skills are minimized not only in the production process itself but also in matters of organization, raw material supply, financing, marketing and so forth. Third, production should be mainly from local materials and for local use. Lastly, rural workplaces should be cheap enough so that they can be created in large numbers. These four requirements together meet the description of what is usually called &lsquo;cottage industry&rsquo;. Millions of them are needed for rural transformation in Nigeria and to check the dangerous process of mutual poisoning between urban and rural areas in the country. the expression As capital is the product of human work seems to support the argument that</span></p>",

It used to be a point of intersection where members of the community not only come&nbsp;to entertain themselves, 'but join heads together'. In the traditional context of African drama, therefore, theatre was popular and respectable institution which preserved the people's culture and tradition. Theatre was popular with the people because it emphasized community participation, peace and progress. The presentations focused on the people's lives, their aspirations, fears, and hopes. But today, the situation is different. Theatre is becoming very unpopular.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Africa of the present age is pre-occupied with many problems yearning for immediate solutions. The continent is facing hydra-head challenges - challenges on the political, social, and economic scenes. In a world where Science and Technology are seen as the solutions to these problems, little attention is paid to the arts. Literature generally, and drama in particular is often rated very low on the utility-scale. Many Africa today look at drama and theatre&nbsp;as a mere thing of fun, a joke so to say.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Elitism is another barrier that militates against the appreciation of theatre&nbsp;as a communal art. Folk&nbsp;theatre is appreciated by a negligible number of people, contemporary focus is on literary theatre. Unfortunately, literary theatre only pretends to serve the interest of its society while in reality, it has a foreign audience in mind. The use of European and American theatrical&nbsp;conventions by our academic playwrights can bear witness to this anomaly.</p>\n<p>The popularity of the literary African theatre is further marred by the medium of communication as most literary dramas in Africa are written in foreign languages which are not understood by many Africans. The question often asked is whether the artist should climb down to the level of his community of stay at his exalted height and wait for the community to gradually move up to him.</p>",
